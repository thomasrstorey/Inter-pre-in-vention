$"Arcturus" is his other name
70
"Arcturus" is his other name-
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
I slew a worm the other day-
A "Savant" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam"-"Centipede"!
"Oh Lord-how frail are we"!
I pull a flower from the woods-
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath-
And has her in a "class"!
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat-
He sits erect in "Cabinets"-
The Clover bells forgot.
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now-
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst"-
Whatever prank betides!
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed-
I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come-
And laugh at me-and stare-
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl-
Old fashioned-naught-everything-
Over the stile of "Pearl."
$"Faith" is a fine invention
185
"Faith" is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see-
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency.
$"Heaven" has different Signs-to me
575
"Heaven" has different Signs-to me-
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place-
And when again, at Dawn,
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills-
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals-
The Orchard, when the Sun is on-
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make-
Some Carnivals of Clouds-
The Rapture of a finished Day-
Returning to the West-
All these-remind us of the place
That Men call "paradise"-
Itself be fairer-we suppose-
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace-
Not yet, our eyes can see-
$"Heaven"-is what I cannot reach!
239
"Heaven"-is what I cannot reach!
The Apple on the Tree-
Provided it do hopeless-hang-
That-"Heaven" is-to Me!
The Color, on the Cruising Cloud-
The interdicted Land-
Behind the Hill-the House behind-
There-Paradise-is found!
Her teasing Purples-Afternoons-
The credulous-decoy-
Enamored-of the Conjuror-
That spurned us-Yesterday!
$"Hope" is the thing with feathers
254
"Hope" is the thing with feathers-
That perches in the soul-
And sings the tune without the words-
And never stops-at all-
And sweetest-in the Gale-is heard-
And sore must be the storm-
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm-
I've heard it in the chillest land-
And on the strangest Sea-
Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb-of Me.
$"Houses"-so the Wise Men tell me
127
"Houses"-so the Wise Men tell me-
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!
Mansions cannot let the tears in,
Mansions must exclude the storm!
"Many Mansions," by "his Father,"
I don't know him; snugly built!
Could the Children find the way there-
Some, would even trudge tonight!
$"I want"-it pleaded-All its life
731
"I want"-it pleaded-All its life-
I want-was chief it said
When Skill entreated it-the last-
And when so newly dead-
I could not deem it late-to hear
That single-steadfast sigh-
The lips had placed as with a "Please"
Toward Eternity-
$"Morning"-means "Milking"-to the Farmer
300
"Morning"-means "Milking"-to the Farmer-
Dawn-to the Teneriffe-
Dice-to the Maid-
Morning means just Risk-to the Lover-
Just revelation-to the Beloved-
Epicures-date a Breakfast-by it-
Brides-an Apocalypse-
Worlds-a Flood-
Faint-going Lives-Their Lapse from Sighing-
Faith-The Experiment of Our Lord
$"Nature" is what we see
668
"Nature" is what we see-
The Hill-the Afternoon-
Squirrel-Eclipse-the Bumble bee-
Nay-Nature is Heaven-
Nature is what we hear-
The Bobolink-the Sea-
Thunder-the Cricket-
Nay-Nature is Harmony-
Nature is what we know-
Yet have no art to say-
So impotent Our Wisdom is
To her Simplicity.
$"Speech"-is a prank of Parliament
688
"Speech"-is a prank of Parliament-
"Tears"-is a trick of the nerve-
But the Heart with the heaviest freight on-
Doesn't-always-move-
$"Unto Me?" I do not know you
964
"Unto Me?" I do not know you-
Where may be your House?
"I am Jesus-Late of Judea-
Now-of Paradise"-
Wagons-have you-to convey me?
This is far from Thence-
"Arms of Mine-sufficient Phaeton-
Trust Omnipotence"-
I am spotted-"I am Pardon"-
I am small-"The Least
Is esteemed in Heaven the Chiefest-
Occupy my House"-
$"Why do I love" You, Sir?
480
"Why do I love" You, Sir?
Because-
The Wind does not require the Grass
To answer-Wherefore when He pass
She cannot keep Her place.
Because He knows-and
Do not You-
And We know not-
Enough for Us
The Wisdom it be so-
The Lightning-never asked an Eye
Wherefore it shut-when He was by-
Because He knows it cannot speak-
And reasons not contained-
-Of Talk-
There be-preferred by Daintier Folk-
The Sunrise-Sire-compelleth Me-
Because He's Sunrise-and I see-
Therefore-Then-
I love Thee-
$A Bird Came Down
A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.
And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
To let a beetle pass.
He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad,--
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;
He stirred his velvet head
Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home
Than oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, splashless, as they swim.
$A Book
There is no frigate like a book
To take us lands away,
Nor any coursers like a page
Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of toll;
How frugal is the chariot
That bears a human soul!
$A Burdock-clawed my Gown
229
A Burdock-clawed my Gown-
Not Burdock's-blame-
But mine-
Who went too near
The Burdock's Den-
A Bog-affronts my shoe-
What else have Bogs-to do-
The only Trade they know-
The splashing Men!
Ah, pity-then!
'Tis Minnows can despise!
The Elephant's-calm eyes
Look further on!
$A Charm invests a face
421
A Charm invests a face
Imperfectly beheld-
The Lady date not lift her Veil
For fear it be dispelled-
But peers beyond her mesh-
And wishes-and denies-
Lest Interview-annul a want
That Image-satisfies-
$A Clock Stopped -- Not The Mantel's
A clock stopped -- not the mantel's
Geneva's farthest skill
Can't put the puppet bowing
That just now dangled still.
An awe came on the trinket!
The figures hunched with pain,
Then quivered out of decimals
Into degreeless noon.
It will not stir for doctors,
This pendulum of snow;
The shopman importunes it,
While cool, concernless No
Nods from the gilded pointers,
Nods from seconds slim,
Decades of arrogance between
The dial life and him.
$A Cloud withdrew from the Sky
895
A Cloud withdrew from the Sky
Superior Glory be
But that Cloud and its Auxiliaries
Are forever lost to me
Had I but further scanned
Had I secured the Glow
In an Hermetic Memory
It had availed me now.
Never to pass the Angel
With a glance and a Bow
Till I am firm in Heaven
Is my intention now.
$A Coffin—is a Small Domain
A Coffin—is a small Domain,
Yet able to contain
A Citizen of Paradise
In it diminished Plane.
A Grave—is a restricted Breadth—
Yet ampler than the Sun—
And all the Seas He populates
And Lands He looks upon
To Him who on its small Repose
Bestows a single Friend—
Circumference without Relief—
Or Estimate—or End—
$A darting fear-a pomp-a tear
87
A darting fear-a pomp-a tear-
A waking on a morn
To find that what one waked for,
Inhales the different dawn.
$A Day! Help! Help! Another Day!
42
A Day! Help! Help! Another Day!
Your prayers, oh Passer by!
From such a common ball as this
Might date a Victory!
From marshallings as simple
The flags of nations swang.
Steady-my soul: What issues
Upon thine arrow hang!
$A Death blow is a Life blow to Some
816
A Death blow is a Life blow to Some
Who till they died, did not alive become-
Who had they lived, had died but when
They died, Vitality begun.
$A door just opened on a street
A door just opened on a street--
I, lost, was passing by--
An instant's width of warmth disclosed
And wealth, and company.
The door as sudden shut, and I,
I, lost, was passing by,--
Lost doubly, but by contrast most,
Enlightening misery.
$A doubt if it be Us
859
A doubt if it be Us
Assists the staggering Mind
In an extremer Anguish
Until it footing find.
An Unreality is lent,
A merciful Mirage
That makes the living possible
While it suspends the lives.
$A drop fell on the apple tree
A drop fell on the apple tree
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.
A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!
The
The
The
The
dust replaced in hoisted roa
birds jocoser sung;
sunshine threw his hat away,
orchards spangles hung.
The breezes brought dejected
And bathed them in the glee;
The East put out a single flag,
And signed the fete away.
$A Dying Tiger-moaned for Drink
566
A Dying Tiger-moaned for Drink-
I hunted all the Sand-
I caught the Dripping of a Rock
And bore it in my Hand-
His Mighty Balls-in death were thick-
But searching-I could see
A Vision on the Retina
Of Water-and of me-
'Twas not my blame-who sped too slow-
'Twas not his blame-who died
While I was reaching him-
But 'twas-the fact that He was dead-
$A feather from the Whippoorwill
161
A feather from the Whippoorwill
That everlasting-sings!
Whose galleries-are Sunrise-
Whose Opera-the Springs-
Whose Emerald Nest the Ages spin
Of mellow-murmuring thread-
Whose Beryl Egg, what Schoolboys hunt
In "Recess"-Overhead!
$A first Mute Coming
702
A first Mute Coming-
In the Stranger's House-
A first fair Going-
When the Bells rejoice-
A first Exchange-of
What hath mingled-been-
For Lot-exhibited to
Faith-alone-
$A fuzzy fellow, without feet
173
A fuzzy fellow, without feet,
Yet doth exceeding run!
Of velvet, is his Countenance,
And his Complexion, dun!
Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass!
Sometime, upon a bough,
From which he doth descend in plush
Upon the Passer-by!
All this in summer.
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk,
He taketh Damask Residence-
And struts in sewing silk!
Then, finer than a Lady,
Emerges in the spring!
A Feather on each shoulder!
You'd scarce recognize him!
By Men, yclept Caterpillar!
By me! But who am I,
To tell the pretty secret
Of the Butterfly!
$A happy lip-breaks sudden
353
A happy lip-breaks sudden-
It doesn't state you how
It contemplated-smiling-
Just consummated-now-
But this one, wears its merriment
So patient-like a pain-
Fresh gilded-to elude the eyes
Unqualified, to scan-
$A House upon the Height
399
A House upon the Height-
That Wagon never reached-
No Dead, were ever carried down-
No Peddler's Cart-approached-
Whose Chimney never smoked-
Whose Windows-Night and Morn-
Caught Sunrise first-and Sunset-last-
Then-held an Empty Pane-
Whose fate-Conjecture knew-
No other neighbor-did-
And what it was-we never lisped-
Because He-never told-
$A Lady red-amid the Hill
74
A Lady red-amid the Hill
Her annual secret keeps!
A Lady white, within the Field
In placid Lily sleeps!
The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms-
Sweep vale-and hill-and tree!
Prithee, My pretty Housewives!
Who may expected be?
The Neighbors do not yet suspect!
The Woods exchange a smile!
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird-
In such a little while!
And yet, how still the Landscape stands!
How nonchalant the Hedge!
As if the "Resurrection"
Were nothing very strange!
$A light exists in spring
A light exists in spring
Not present on the year
At any other period.
When March is scarcely here
A color stands abroad
On solitary hills
That science cannot overtake,
But human naturefeels.
It waits upon the lawn;
It shows the furthest tree
Upon the furthest slope we know;
It almost speaks to me.
Then, as horizons step,
Or noons report away,
Without the formula of sound,
It passes, and we stay:
A quality of loss
Affecting our content,
As trade had suddenly encroached
Upon a sacrament.
$A little bread-a crust-a crumb
159
A little bread-a crust-a crumb-
A little trust-a demijohn-
Can keep the soul alive-
Not portly, mind! but breathing-warm-
Conscious-as old Napoleon,
The night before the Crown!
A modest lot-A fame petite-
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet
Is plenty! Is enough!
A Sailor's business is the shore!
A Soldier's-balls! Who asketh more,
Must seek the neighboring life!
$A little East of Jordan
59
A little East of Jordan,
Evangelists record,
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard-
Till morning touching mountain-
And Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast-to return-
Not so, said cunning Jacob!
"I will not let thee go
Except thou bless me"-Stranger!
The which acceded to-
Light swung the silver fleeces
"Peniel" Hills beyond,
And the bewildered Gymnast
Found he had worsted God!
$A little road not made man
A little road not made of man,
Enabled of the eye,
Accessible to thill of bee,
Or cart of butterfly.
If town it have, beyond itself,
'T is that I cannot say;
I only sigh,--no vehicle
Bears me along that way.
$A long, long sleep, a famous sleep
A long, long sleep, a famous sleep
That makes no show for dawn
By strech of limb or stir of lid, --
An independent one.
Was ever idleness like this?
Within a hut of stone
To bask the centuries away
Nor once look up for noon?
$A loss of something ever felt I
959
A loss of something ever felt I-
The first that I could recollect
Bereft I was-of what I knew not
Too young that any should suspect
A Mourner walked among the children
I notwithstanding went about
As one bemoaning a Dominion
Itself the only Prince cast out-
Elder, Today, a session wiser
And fainter, too, as Wiseness is-
I find myself still softly searching
For my Delinguent Palaces-
And a Suspicion, like a Finger
Touches my Forehead now and then
That I am looking oppositely
For the site of the Kingdom of Heaven-
$A Man may make a Remark
952
A Man may make a Remark-
In itself-a quiet thing
That may furnish the Fuse unto a Spark
In dormant nature-lain-
Let us deport-with skill-
Let us discourse-with care-
Powder exists in Charcoal-
Before it exists in Fire.
$A Mien to move a Queen
283
A Mien to move a Queen-
Half Child-Half Heroine-
An Orleans in the Eye
That puts its manner by
For humbler Company
When none are near
Even a Tear-
Its frequent Visitor-
A Bonnet like a Duke-
And yet a Wren's Peruke
Were not so shy
Of Goer by-
And Hands-so slight-
They would elate a Sprite
With Merriment-
A Voice that Alters-Low
And on the Ear can go
Like Let of Snow-
Or shift supreme-
As tone of Realm
On Subjects Diadem-
Too small-to fear-
Too distant-to endear-
And so Men Compromise
And just-revere-
$A Moth the hue of this
841
A Moth the hue of this
Haunts Candles in Brazil.
Nature's Experience would make
Our Reddest Second pale.
Nature is fond, I sometimes think,
Of Trinkets, as a Girl.
$A Murmur in the Trees-to note
416
A Murmur in the Trees-to note-
Not loud enough-for Wind-
A Star-not far enough to seek-
Nor near enough-to find-
A long-long Yellow-on the Lawn-
A Hubbub-as of feet-
Not audible-as Ours-to Us-
But dapperer-More Sweet-
A Hurrying Home of little Men
To Houses unperceived-
All this-and more-if I should tell-
Would never be believed-
Of Robins in the Trundle bed
How many I espy
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings-
Although I heard them try-
But then I promised ne'er to tell-
How could I break My Word?
So go your Way-and I'll go Mine-
No fear you'll miss the Road.
$A narrow fellow in the grass
A narrow fellow in the grass
Occasionally rides;
You may have met him,--did you not,
His notice sudden is.
The grass divides as with a comb,
A spotted shaft is seen;
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on.
He likes a boggy acre,
A floor too cool for corn.
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
I more than once, at morn,
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
Unbraiding in the sun,--
When, stooping to secure it,
It wrinkled, and was gone.
Several of nature's people
I know, and they know me;
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality;
But never met this fellow,
Attended or alone,
Without a tighter breathing,
And zero at the bone.
$A nearness to Tremendousness
963
A nearness to Tremendousness-
An Agony procures-
Affliction ranges Boundlessness-
Vicinity to Laws
Contentment's quiet Suburb-
Affliction cannot stay
In Acres-Its Location
Is Illocality-
$A Night-there lay the Days between
471
A Night-there lay the Days between-
The Day that was Before-
And Day that was Behind-were one-
And now-'twas Night-was here-
Slow-Night-that must be watched away-
As Grains upon a shore-
Too imperceptible to note-
Till it be night-no more-
$A Planted Life-diversified
806
A Planted Life-diversified
With Gold and Silver Pain
To prove the presence of the Ore
In Particles-'tis when
A Value struggle-it exist-
A Power-will proclaim
Although Annihilation pile
Whole Chaoses on Him-
$A poor-torn heart-a tattered heart
78
A poor-torn heart-a tattered heart-
That sat it down to rest-
Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day
Flowed silver to the West-
Nor noticed Night did soft descend-
Nor Constellation burn-
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.
The angels-happening that way
This dusty heart espied-
Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God-
There-sandals for the Barefoot-
There-gathered from the gales-
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering Sails.
$A precious—mouldering pleasure
371
A precious—mouldering pleasure—'tis—
To meet an Antique Book—
In just the Dress his Century wore—
A privilege—I think—
His venerable Hand to take—
And warming in our own—
A passage back—or two—to make—
To Times when he—was young—
His quaint opinions—to inspect—
His thought to ascertain
On Themes concern our mutual mind—
The Literature of Man—
What interested Scholars—most—
What Competitions ran—
When Plato—was a Certainty—
And Sophocles—a Man—
When Sappho—was a living Girl—
And Beatrice wore
The Gown that Dante—deified—
Facts Centuries before
He traverses—familiar—
As One should come to Town—
And tell you all your Dreams—were true—
He lived—where Dreams were born—
His presence is Enchantment—
You beg him not to go—
Old Volume shake their Vellum Heads
And tantalize—just so—
$A Prison gets to be a friend
652
A Prison gets to be a friend-
Between its Ponderous face
And Ours-a Kinsmanship express-
And in its narrow Eyes-
We come to look with gratitude
For the appointed Beam
It deal us-stated as our food-
And hungered for-the same-
We learn to know the Planks-
That answer to Our feet-
So miserable a sound-at first-
Nor ever now-so sweet-
As plashing in the Pools-
When Memory was a Boy-
But a Demurer Circuit-
A Geometric Joy-
The Posture of the Key
That interrupt the Day
To Our Endeavor-Not so real
The Check of Liberty-
As this Phantasm Steel-
Whose features-Day and Night-
Are present to us-as Our Own-
And as escapeless-quite-
The narrow Round-the Stint-
The slow exchange of Hope-
For something passiver-Content
Too steep for lookinp up-
The Liberty we knew
Avoided-like a Dream-
Too wide for any Night but Heaven-
If That-indeed-redeem-
$A Route of Evanescence
A Route of Evanescence
With a revolving Wheel--
A Resonance of Emerald--
A Rush of Cochineal--
And every Blossom on the Bush
Adjusts its tumbled Head--
The mail from Tunis, probably,
An easy Morning's Ride--
$A science-so the Savants say
100
A science-so the Savants say,
"Comparative Anatomy"-
By which a single bone-
Is made a secret to unfold
Of some rare tenant of the mold,
Else perished in the stone-
So to the eye prospective led,
This meekest flower of the mead
Upon a winter's day,
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily, manifold,
And countless Butterfly!
$A Secret told

A Secret told-
Ceases to be a Secret-then-
A Secret-kept-

Better of it-continual be afraid-
Than it-
And Whom you told it to-beside-
$A sepal, petal, and a thorn
19
A sepal, petal, and a thorn
Upon a common summer's morn-
A flask of Dew-A Bee or two-
A Breeze-a caper in the trees-
And I'm a Rose!
$A Shade upon the mind there passes
882
A Shade upon the mind there passes
As when on Noon
A Cloud the mighty Sun encloses
Remembering
That some there be too numb to notice
Oh God
Why give if Thou must take away
The Loved?
$A shady friend for torrid days
A shady friend for torrid days
Is easier to find
Than one of higher temperature
For frigid hour of mind.
The vane a little to the east
Scares muslin souls away;
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
Than those of organdy,
Who is to blame? The weaver?
Ah! the bewildering thread!
The tapestries of paradise!
So notelessly are made!
$A single Screw of Flesh
263
Is all that pins the Soul
That stands for Deity, to Mine,
Upon my side the Veil-
Once witnessed of the Gauze-
Its name is put away
As far from mine, as if no plight
Had printed yesterday,
In tender-solemn Alphabet,
My eyes just turned to see,
When it was smuggled by my sight
Into Eternity-
More Hands-to hold-These are but Two-
One more new-mailed Nerve
Just granted, for the Peril's sake-
Some striding-Giant-Love-
So greater than the Gods can show,
They slink before the Clay,
That not for all their Heaven can boast
Will let its Keepsake-go
$A slash of Blue
204
A slash of Blue-
A sweep of Gray-
Some scarlet patches on the way,
Compose an Evening Sky-
A little purple-slipped between-
Some Ruby Trousers hurried on-
A Wave of Gold-
A Bank of Day-
This just makes out the Morning Sky.
$A Solemn thing within the Soul
483
A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe-
And golden hang-while farther up-
The Maker's Ladders stop-
And in the Orchard far below-
You hear a Being-drop-
A Wonderful-to feel the Sun
Still toiling at the Cheek
You thought was finished-
Cool of eye, and critical of Work-
He shifts the stem-a little-
To give your Core-a look-
But solemnest-to know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearer-Every Sun
The Single-to some lives.
$A solemn thing-it was-I said
271
A solemn thing-it was-I said-
A woman-white-to be-
And wear-if God should count me fit-
Her blameless mystery-
A hallowed thing-to drop a life
Into the purple well-
Too plummetless-that it return-
Eternity-until-
I pondered how the bliss would look-
And would it feel as big-
When I could take it in my hand-
As hovering-seen-through fog-
And then-the size of this "small" life-
The Sages-call it small-
Swelled-like Horizons-in my vest-
And I sneered-softly-"small"!
$A something in a summer's Day
122
A something in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me.
A something in a summer's noon-
A depth-an Azure-a perfume-
Transcending ecstasy.
And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see-
Then veil my too inspecting face
Lets such a subtle-shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me-
The wizard fingers never rest-
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes it narrow bed-
Still rears the East her amber Flag-
Guides still the sun along the Crag
His Caravan of Red-
So looking on-the night-the morn
Conclude the wonder gay-
And I meet, coming thro' the dews
Another summer's Day!
$A South Wind-has a pathos
719
A South Wind-has a pathos
Of individual Voice-
As One detect on Landings
An Emigrant's address.
A Hint of Ports and Peoples-
And much not understood-
The fairer-for the farness-
And for the foreignhood.
$A still—Volcano—Life
601
A still—Volcano—Life—
That flickered in the night—
When it was dark enough to do
Without erasing sight—
A quiet—Earthquake Style—
Too subtle to suspect
By natures this side Naples—
The North cannot detect
The Solemn—Torrid—Symbol—
The lips that never lie—
Whose hissing Corals part—and shut—
And Cities—ooze away—
$A thought went up my mind to-day
A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish,--some way back,
I could not fix the year,
Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.
But somewhere in my soul, I know
I've met the thing before;
It just reminded me--'t was all--
And came my way no more.
$A throe upon the features
71
A throe upon the features-
A hurry in the breath-
An ecstasy of parting
Denominated "Death"-
An anguish at the mention
Which when to patience grown,
I've known permission given
To rejoin its own.
$A toad can die of light!
A toad can die of light!
Death is the common right
Of toads and men,--
Of earl and midge
The privilege.
Why swagger then?
The gnat's supremacy
Is large as thine.

A Tongue—to tell Him I am true!

$A Tooth upon Our Peace

A Tooth upon Our Peace
The Peace cannot deface-
Then Wherefore be the Tooth?
To vitalize the Grace-
The Heaven hath a Hell-
Itself to signalize-
And every sign before the Place
Is Gilt with Sacrifice-

A Visitor in Marl-
Who influences Flowers-
Till they are orderly as Busts-
And Elegant-as Glass-
Who visits in the Night-
And just before the Sun-
Concludes his glistening interview-
Caresses-and is gone-
But whom his fingers touched-
And where his feet have run-
And whatsoever Mouth be kissed-
Is as it had not been-

A Weight with Needles on the pounds-
To push, and pierce, besides-

As manifold for Anguish-
As Species-be-for name-
$A Wife-at daybreak I shall be

A Wife-at daybreak I shall be-
Sunrise-Hast thou a Flag for me?
At Midnight, I am but a Maid,
How short it takes to make a Bride-
Then-Midnight, I have passed from thee
Unto the East, and Victory-
Midnight-Good Night! I hear them call,
The Angels bustle in the Hall-
Softly my Future climbs the Stair,
I fumble at my Childhood's prayer
So soon to be a Child no more-
Eternity, I'm coming-Sire,
Savior-I've seen the face-before!
$A Wounded Deer-leaps highest
165
A Wounded Deer-leaps highest-
I've heard the Hunter tell-
'Tis but the Ecstasy of death-
And then the Brake is still!
The Smitten Rock that gushes!
The trampled Steel that springs!
A Cheek is always redder
Just where the Hectic stings!
Mirth is the Mail of Anguish
In which it Cautious Arm,
Lest anybody spy the blood
And "you're hurt" exclaim!
$Abraham to Kill Him
Abraham to kill him
Was distinctly told—
Isaac was an Urchin—

Lived to tell the tale—

$Adrift! A little boat adrift!
30
Adrift! A little boat adrift!
And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
Unto the nearest town?
So Sailors say-on yesterday-
Just as the dusk was brown
One little boat gave up its strife
And gurgled down and down.
So angels say-on yesterday-
Just as the dawn was red
One little boat-o'erspent with gales-
Retrimmed its masts-redecked its sails-
And shot-exultant on!
$Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?

Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?
Not Death-for who is He?
The Porter of my Father's Lodge
As much abasheth me!
Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear [a] thing
That comprehendeth me
In one or two existences-
As Deity decree-
Of Resurrection? Is the East
Afraid to trust the Morn
With her fastidious forehead?
As soon impeach my Crown!
$After a hundred years
After a hundred years
Nobody knows the place,--
Agony, that enacted there,
Motionless as peace.
Weeds triumphant ranged,
Strangers strolled and spelled
At the lone orthography
Of the elder dead.
Winds of summer fields
Recollect the way,--
Instinct picking up the key
Dropped by memory.
$After Great Pain, A Formal Feeling Comes
After great pain, a formal feeling comes--
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Toombs--
The stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore,
And Yesterday, or Centuries before?
The Feet, mechanical, go round--
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought--
A Wooden way
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone--
This is the Hour of Lead--
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons recollect the Snow--
First--Chill--then Stupor--then the letting go--
$After great pain, a formal feeling comes -- (341)

Again-his voice is at the door-
I feel the old Degree-
I hear him ask the servant
For such an one-as me-
I take a flower-as I go-
My face to justify-
He never saw me-in this life-
I might surprise his eye!
I cross the Hall with mingled steps-
I-silent-pass the door-
I look on all this world contains-
Just his face-nothing more!
We talk in careless-and it toss-
A kind of plummet strain-
Each-sounding-shyly-
Just-how-deep-
The other's one-had been-
We walk-I leave my Dog-at home-
A tender-thoughtful Moon-
Goes with us-just a little way-
And-then-we are alone-
Alone-if Angels are "alone"-
First time they try the sky!
Alone-if those "veiled faces"-be-
We cannot count-on High!

The purple-in my Vein-
But He must count the drops-himself-
My price for every stain!

Ah, Moon—and Star!
You are very far—
But were no one
Farther than you—
Do you think I'd stop
For a Firmament—
Or a Cubit—or so?
I could borrow a Bonnet
Of the Lark—
And a Chamois' Silver Boot—
And a stirrup of an Antelope—
And be with you—Tonight!
But, Moon, and Star,
Though you're very far—
There is one—farther than you—
He—is more than a firmament—from Me—
So I can never go!

Just a paltry One-

Less accounted than

All overgrown by cunning moss,
All interspersed with weed,
The little cage of "Currer Bell"
In quiet "Haworth" laid.
Gathered from many wanderings-
Gethsemane can tell
Thro' what transporting anguish
She reached the Asphodel!
Soft falls the sounds of Eden
Upon her puzzled ear-
Oh what an afternoon for Heaven,
When "Bronte" entered there!

$All these my banners be

I sow my pageantry
In May-
It rises train by train-
Then sleeps in state again-
My chancel-all the plain
Today.
To lose-if one can find again-
To miss-if one shall meet-
The Burglar cannot rob-then-
The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaily
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy
And for Columbine-
You and I the secret
Of the Crocus know-
Let us chant it softly-
"There is no more snow!"
To him who keeps an Orchis' heart-
The swamps are pink with June.

An Ornament too grand
For Forehead low as mine, to wear,
This might have been the Hand
That sowed the flower, he preferred-
Or smoothed a homely pain,
Or pushed the pebble from his path-
Or played his chosen tune-
On Lute the least-the latest-
But just his Ear could know
That whatsoe'er delighted it,
I never would let go-
The foot to bear his errand-
A little Boot I know-
Would leap abroad like Antelope-
With just the grant to do-
His weariest Commandment-
A sweeter to obey,
Than "Hide and Seek"-
Or skip to Flutes-
Or all Day, chase the Bee-
Your Servant, Sir, will weary-
The Surgeon, will not come-
The World, will have its own-to do-
The Dust, will vex your Fame-
The Cold will force your tightest door
Some February Day,
But say my apron bring the sticks
To make your Cottage gay-
That I may take that promise
To Paradise, with me-
To teach the Angels, avarice,
You, Sir, taught first-to me.

Every Dawn, is first.

$An altered look about the hills

An altered look about the hills-
A Tyrian light the village fills-
A wider sunrise in the morn-
A deeper twilight on the lawn-
A print of a vermillion foot-
A purple finger on the slope-
A flippant fly upon the pane-
A spider at his trade again-
An added strut in Chanticleer-
A flower expected everywhere-
An axe shrill singing in the woods-
Fern odors on untravelled roads-
All this and more I cannot tell-
A furtive look you know as well-
And Nicodemus' Mystery
Receives its annual reply!
$An awful Tempest mashed the air
198
An awful Tempest mashed the air-
The clouds were gaunt, and few-
A Black-as of a Spectre's Cloak
Hid Heaven and Earth from view.
The creatures chuckled on the Roofs-
And whistled in the air-
And shook their fists-
And gnashed their teeth-
And swung their frenzied hair.
The morning lit-the Birds arose-
The Monster's faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coast-
And peace-was Paradise!
$An English Breeze
UP with the sun, the breeze arose,
Across the talking corn she goes,
And smooth she rustles far and wide
Through all the voiceful countryside.
Through all the land her tale she tells;
She spins, she tosses, she compels
The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails
And all the trees in all the dales.
God calls us, and the day prepares
With nimble, gay and gracious airs:
And from Penzance to Maidenhead
The roads last night He watered.
God calls us from inglorious ease,
Forth and to travel with the breeze
While, swift and singing, smooth and strong
She gallops by the fields along.

In Immortality-

And this of all my Hopes

Never a Worm so confident
Bored at so brave a Root

Parched the flowers they bear along.

To any happy flower,

In accidental power.
The blond assassin passes on.

To measure off another day,
For an approving God.
$Arcturus
"Arcturus" is his other name—
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
I slew a worm the other day—
A "Savant" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam"—"Centipede"!
"Oh Lord—how frail are we"!
I pull a flower from the woods—
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath—
And has her in a "class"!
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat—
He sits erect in "Cabinets"—
The Clover bells forgot.
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now—
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst"—
Whatever prank betides!
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed—
I hope the "Children" there Won't be "new fashioned" when I come—
And laugh at me—and stare—
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl—
Old fashioned—naught—everything—
Over the stile of "Pearl."

And shatter me with Dawn!

Until it puzzled came
To continents of summer-
To firmaments of sun-

And birds, of foreign tongue!
I say, As if this little flower
To Eden, wandered in-
What then? Why nothing,
Only, your inference therefrom!

As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed away-
Too imperceptible at last
To seem like Perfidy-
A Quietness distilled
As Twilight long begun,
Or Nature spending with herself
Sequestered Afternoon-
The Dusk drew earlier in-
The Morning foreign shone-
A courteous, yet harrowing Grace,
As Guest, that would be gone-
And thus, without a Wing
Or service of a Keel
Our Summer made her light escape
Into the Beautiful.

As the Tiger eased
By but a Crumb of Blood, fasts Scarlet
Till he meet a Man
Dainty adorned with Veins and Tissues
And partakes-his Tongue
Cooled by the Morsel for a moment
Grows a fiercer thing
Till he esteem his Dates and Cocoa

Deem my Supper dry
For but a Berry of Domingo
And a Torrid Eye.

As brooks in deserts babble sweet
On ear too far for the delight,

Opens the lid of Amethyst
And lets the morning go-
That Beggar, when an honored Guest,
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed,

Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!
Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,
Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,
Their spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows,
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll,
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul:
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower-
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum-
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!

He kindly stopped for me--
The Carriage held but just Ourselves--
And Immortality.
We slowly drove--He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility--
We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess--in the Ring--
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain--
We passed the Setting Sun--
Or rather--He passed us--
The Dews drew quivering and chill--
For only Gossamer, my Gown--
My Tippet--only Tulle--
We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground--

Were toward Eternity--

May lift a look on thine, a Maid
Alway a Flower would be.
Nor Robins, Robins need not hide
When Thou upon their Crypts intrude
So Wings bestow on Me
Or Petals, or a Dower of Buzz
That Bee to ride, or Flower of Furze
I that way worship Thee.
$Beclouded
The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow
Across a barn or through a rut
Debates if it will go.
A narrow wind complains all day
How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem.
$Bee! I'm expecting you!
1035
Bee! I'm expecting you!
Was saying Yesterday
To Somebody you know
That you were due-
The Frogs got Home last Week-
Are settled, and at work-
Birds, mostly back-
The Clover warm and thick-
You'll get my Letter by
The seventeenth; Reply
Or better, be with me-
Yours, Fly.

$Before I got my eye put out

Before I got my eye put out
I liked as well to see-
As other Creatures, that have Eyes
And know no other way-
But were it told to me-Today-
That I might have the sky
For mine-I tell you that my Heart
Would split, for size of me-
The Meadows-mine-
The Mountains-mine-
All Forests-Stintless Stars-
As much of Noon as I could take
Between my finite eyes-
The Motions of the Dipping Birds-
The Morning's Amber Road-
For mine-to look at when I liked-
The News would strike me dead-
So safer-guess-with just my soul
Upon the Window pane-
Where other Creatures put their eyes-
Incautious-of the Sun-
$Before the ice is in the pools
37
Before the ice is in the pools-
Before the skaters go,
Or any check at nightfall
Is tarnished by the snow-
Before the fields have finished,
Before the Christmas tree,
Wonder upon wonder
Will arrive to me!
What we touch the hems of
On a summer's day-
What is only walking
Just a bridge away-
That which sings so-speaks so-
When there's no one here-
Will the frock I wept in
Answer me to wear?
$Before you thought of spring,
Before you thought of spring,
Except as a surmise,
You see, God bless his suddenness,
A fellow in the skies
Of independent hues,
A little weather-worn,
Inspiriting habiliments
Of indigo and brown.
With specimens of song,
As if for you to choose,
Discretion in the interval,
With gay delays he goes
To some superior tree
Without a single leaf,
And shouts for joy to nobody
But his seraphic self!
$Behind Me-dips Eternity

Behind Me-dips Eternity-
Before Me-Immortality-
Myself-the Term between-
Death but the Drift of Eastern Gray,
Dissolving into Dawn away,
Before the West begin-
'Tis Kingdoms-afterward-they say-
In perfect-pauseless Monarchy-
Whose Prince-is Son of None-
Himself-His Dateless Dynasty-
Himself-Himself diversify-
In Duplicate divine-
'Tis Miracle before Me-then-

A Crescent in the Sea-
With Midnight to the North of Her-
And Midnight to the South of Her-
And Maelstrom-in the Sky-
$Bereaved of all, I went abroad
784
Bereaved of all, I went abroad-
No less bereaved was I
Upon a New Peninsula-
The Grave preceded me-
Obtained my Lodgings, ere myself-
And when I sought my Bed-
The Grave it was reposed upon
The Pillow for my Head-
I waked to find it first awake-
I rose-It followed me-
I tried to drop it in the Crowd-
To lose it in the Sea-
In Cups of artificial Drowse
To steep its shape away-
The Grave-was finished-but the Spade
Remained in Memory-
$Bereavement in their death to feel

Bereavement in their death to feel
Whom We have never seen-
A Vital Kinsmanship import
Our Soul and theirs-between-
For Stranger-Strangers do not mourn-
There be Immortal friends
Whom Death see first-'tis news of this
That paralyze Ourselves-
Who, vital only to Our Thought-
Such Presence bear away
In dying-'tis as if Our Souls
Absconded-suddenly-
$Besides the Autumn poets sing

Besides the Autumn poets sing
A few prosaic days
A little this side of the snow
And that side of the Haze-
A few incisive Mornings-
A few Ascetic Eves-
Gone-Mr. Bryant's "Golden Rod"-
And Mr. Thomson's "sheaves."
Still, is the bustle in the Brook-
Sealed are the spicy valves-
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The Eyes of many Elves-
Perhaps a squirrel may remain-
My sentiments to share-
Grant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind-
Thy windy will to bear!

$Bird
A bird came down the walk:
He did not know I saw;
He bit an angle-worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw.
And then he drank a dew
From a convenient grass,
And the hopped sideways to the wall
To let a beetle pass.
He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all abroad, -
They looked like frightened beads, I thought
He stirred his velvet head.
Like one in danger; cautious,
I offered him a crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers
And rolled him softer home
Then oars divide the ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,
Leap, plashless, as they swim.

Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple
Leaping like Leopards to the Sky
Then at the feet of the old Horizon

Touching the Roof and tinting the Barn
Kissing her Bonnet to the Meadow
And the Juggler of Day is gone
$Bless God, he went as soldiers

I should not fear the fight!

And say how many Dew,
Tell me how far the morning leaps-
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
Who spun the breadth of blue!
Write me how many notes there be
In the new Robin's ecstasy
Among astonished boughs-
How many trips the Tortoise makes-
How many cups the Bee partakes,
The Debauchee of Dews!
Also, who laid the Rainbow's piers,
Also, who leads the docile spheres
By withes of supple blue?
Whose fingers string the stalactite-
Who counts the wampum of the night
To see that none is due?

And shut the windows down so close

Who'll let me out some gala day
With implements to fly away,

Just a Sea-with a Stem-
If the Bird and the Farmer-deem it a "Pine"-

It has no Port, nor a "Line"-but the Jays-
That split their route to the Sky-
Or a Squirrel, whose giddy Peninsula
May be easier reached-this way-
For Inlands-the Earth is the under side-
And the upper side-is the Sun-
And its Commerce-if Commerce it have-

$By The Sea
I started early, took my dog,
And visited the sea;
The mermaids in the basement
Came out to look at me.
And frigates in the upper floor
Extended hempen hands,
Presuming me to be a mouse
Aground, upon the sands.
But no man moved me till the tide
Went past my simple shoe,
And past my apron and my belt,
And past my bodice too,
And made as he would eat me up
As wholly as a dew
Upon a dandelion's sleeve -
And then I started too.
And he - he followed close behind;
I felt his silver heel
Upon my ankle, - then my shoes
Would overflow with pearl.
Until we met the solid town,
No man he seemed to know;
And bowing with a mighty look
At me, the sea withdrew.
$Chartless
I never saw a moor,
I never saw the sea;
Yet now I know how the heather looks,
And what a wave must be.
I never spoke with God,
Nor visited in Heaven;
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the chart were given.

Then wiser than a "Surrogate,"

And marry whom I may
And dwell a little everywhere
Or better, run away
With no Police to follow
Or chase Him if He do
Till He should jump Peninsulas
To get away from me-

Upon a Raft of Air
And row in Nowhere all Day long
And anchor "off the Bar"
What Liberty! So Captives deem

Industrious until

The stitches stopped themselves,
And then 't was put among the dust
Upon the closet shelves.

Obliterate the etchings
Too costly for repairs.

Have climbed the distant hill-
Had not the bliss so slow a pace

Horses of Blonde-and Coach of Silver-
Baggage a strapped Pearl-
Journey of Down-and Whip of Diamond-
Riding to meet the Earl-
$Dust is the only Secret
153
Dust is the only Secret-
Death, the only One
You cannot find out all about
In his "native town."
Nobody know "his Father"-
Never was a Boy-
Hadn't any playmates,
Or "Early history"-
Industrious! Laconic!
Punctual! Sedate!
Bold as a Brigand!
Stiller than a Fleet!
Builds, like a Bird, too!
Christ robs the Nest-
Robin after Robin
Smuggled to Rest!
$Dying (I heard a fly buzz when I died)
I heard a fly buzz when I died;
The stillness round my form
Was like the stillness in the air
Between the heaves of storm.
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
And breaths were gathering sure
For that last onset, when the king
Be witnessed in his power.
I willed my keepsakes, signed away
What portion of me I
Could make assignable, -- and then
There interposed a fly,
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
Between the light and me;
And then the windows failed, and then
I could not see to see.
$Dying! Dying in the night!
158
Dying! Dying in the night!
Won't somebody bring the light
So I can see which way to go
Into the everlasting snow?
And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone?
They said that Jesus-always came-
Perhaps he doesn't know the House-
This way, Jesus, Let him pass!
Somebody run to the great gate
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait!
I hear her feet upon the stair!
Death won't hurt-now Dollie's here!
$Dying! To be afraid of thee
831
Dying! To be afraid of thee
One must to thine Artillery
Have left exposed a Friend-
Than thine old Arrow is a Shot
Delivered straighter to the Heart
The leaving Love behind.
Not for itself, the Dust is shy,
But, enemy, Beloved be
Thy Batteries divorce.
Fight sternly in a Dying eye
Two Armies, Love and Certainty
And Love and the Reverse.
$Each life converges to some centre
Each life converges to some centre
Expressed or still;
Exists in every human nature
A goal,
Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
Too fair
For credibility's temerity
To dare.
Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
To reach
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
To touch,
Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
How high
Unto the saints' slow diligence
The sky!
Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
But then,
Eternity enables the endeavoring
Again.
$Each Scar I'll keep for Him
877
Each Scar I'll keep for Him
Instead I'll say of Gem
In His long Absence worn
A Costlier one
But every Tear I bore
Were He to count them o'er
His own would fall so more
I'll mis sum them.
$Each Second is the last
879
Each Second is the last
Perhaps, recalls the Man
Just measuring unconsciousness
The Sea and Spar between.
To fail within a Chance-
How terribler a thing
Than perish from the Chance's list
Before the Perishing!
$Elysium is as far as to
Elysium is as far as to
The very nearest Room
If in that Room a Friend await
Felicity or Doom--
What fortitude the Soul contains
That it can so endure
The accent of a coming Foot--
The opening of a Door--
$Embarrassment of one another
662
Embarrassment of one another
And God
Is Revelation's limit,
Aloud
Is nothing that is chief,
But still,
Divinity dwells under a seal.
$Empty my Heart, of Thee
587
Empty my Heart, of Thee-
Its single Artery-
Begin, and leave Thee out-
Simply Extinction's Date-
Much Billow hath the Sea-
One Baltic-They-
Subtract Thyself, in play,
And not enough of me
Is left-to put away-
"Myself" meanth Thee-
Erase the Root-no Tree-
Thee-then-no me-
The Heavens stripped-
Eternity's vast pocket, picked-
$Endow the Living—with the Tears
521
Endow the Living—with the Tears—
You squander on the Dead,
And They were Men and Women—now,
Around Your Fireside—
Instead of Passive Creatures,
Denied the Cherishing
Till They—the Cherishing deny—
With Death's Ethereal Scron—
$Escaping backward to perceive
867
Escaping backward to perceive
The Sea upon our place-
Escaping forward, to confront
His glittering Embrace-
Retreating up, a Billow's height
Retreating blinded down
Our undermining feet to meet
Instructs to the Divine.
$Essential Oils—are wrung
675
Essential Oils—are wrung—
The Attar from the Rose
Be not expressed by Suns—alone—
It is the gift of Screws—
The General Rose—decay—
But this—in Lady's Drawer
Make Summer—When the Lady lie
In Ceaseless Rosemary—
$Except the Heaven had come so near
472
Except the Heaven had come so near-
So seemed to choose My Door-
The Distance would not haunt me so-
I had not hoped-before-
But just to hear the Grace depart-
I never thought to see-
Afflicts me with a Double loss-
'Tis lost-and lost to me-
$Except to Heaven, she is nought
154
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
Except for Angels-lone.
Except to some wide-wandering Bee
A flower superfluous blown.
Except for winds-provincial.
Except by Butterflies
Unnoticed as a single dew
That on the Acre lies.
The smallest Housewife in the grass,
Yet take her from the Lawn
And somebody has lost the face
That made Existence-Home!
$Exclusion (The soul selects her own society)
The soul selects her own society,
Then shuts the door;
On her divine majority
Obtrude no more.
Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
At her low gate;
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
Upon her mat.
I've known her from an ample nation
Choose one
Then close the valves of her attention
Like stone.
$Exhilaration—is within
383
Exhilaration—is within—
There can no Outer Wine
So royally intoxicate
As that diviner Brand
The Soul achieves—Herself—
To drink—or set away
For Visitor—Or Sacrament—
'Tis not of Holiday
To stimulate a Man
Who hath the Ample Rhine
Within his Closet—Best you can
Exhale in offering.
$Expectation—is Contentment
807
Expectation—is Contentment—
Gain—Satiety—
But Satiety—Conviction
Of Necessity
Of an Austere trait in Pleasure—
Good, without alarm
Is a too established Fortune—
Danger—deepens Sum—
$Experience is the Angled Road
910
Experience is the Angled Road
Preferred against the Mind
By-Paradox-the Mind itself-
Presuming it to lead
Quite Opposite-How Complicate
The Discipline of Man-
Compelling Him to Choose Himself
His Preappointed Pain-
$Exultation is the going
76
Exultation is the going
Of an inland soul to sea,
Past the houses-past the headlands-
Into deep Eternity-
Bred as we, among the mountains,
Can the sailor understand
The divine intoxication
Of the first league out from land?
$Fairer through Fading—as the Day
938
Fairer through Fading—as the Day
Into the Darkness dips away—
Half Her Complexion of the Sun—
Hindering—Haunting—Perishing—
Rallies Her Glow, like a dying Friend—
Teasing with glittering Amend—
Only to aggravate the Dark
Through an expiring—perfect—look—
$Faith
"Faith" is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see—
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency.
$Faith—is the Pierless Bridge
915
Faith—is the Pierless Bridge
Supporting what We see
Unto the Scene that We do not—
Too slender for the eye
It bears the Soul as bold
As it were rocked in Steel
With Arms of Steel at either side—
It joins—behind the Veil
To what, could We presume
The Bridge would cease to be
To Our far, vacillating Feet
A first Necessity.
$Fame is a bee
1763
Fame is a bee.
It has a song-
It has a sting-
Ah, too, it has a wing.
$Fame is a fickle food (1659)
Fame is a fickle food
Upon a shifting plate
Whose table once a
Guest but not
The second time is set.
Whose crumbs the crows inspect
And with ironic caw
Flap past it to the Farmer's Corn--
Men eat of it and die.
$Fame is the tine that Scholars leave
866
Fame is the tine that Scholars leave
Upon their Setting Names-
The Iris not of Occident
That disappears as comes-
$Fame of Myself, to justify
713
Fame of Myself, to justify,
All other Plaudit be
Superfluous-An Incense
Beyond Necessity-
Fame of Myself to lack-Although
My Name be else Supreme-
This were an Honor honorless-
A futile Diadem-
$Finding is the first Act
870
Finding is the first Act
The second, loss,
Third, Expedition for
The "Golden Fleece"
Fourth, no Discovery-
Fifth, no Crew-
Finally, no Golden Fleece-
Jason-sham-too.
$Finite—to fail, but infinite to Venture
847
Finite—to fail, but infinite to Venture—
For the one ship that struts the shore
Many's the gallant—overwhelmed Creature
Nodding in Navies nevermore—
$First Robin
I dreaded that first robin so,
But he is mastered now,
And I'm accustomed to him grown,--
He hurts a little, though.
I thought if I could only live
Till that first shout got by,
Not all pianos in the woods
Had power to mangle me.
I dared not meet the daffodils,
For fear their yellow gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own.
I wished the grass would hurry,
So when 't was time to see,
He'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch to look at me.
I could not bear the bees should come,
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go:
What word had they for me?
They're here, though; not a creature failed,
No blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me,
The Queen of Calvary.
Each one salutes me as he goes,
And I my childish plumes
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking drums.
$Fitter to see Him, I may be
968
Fitter to see Him, I may be
For the long Hindrance-Grace-to Me-
With Summers, and with Winters, grow,
Some passing Year-A trait bestow
To make Me fairest of the Earth-
The Waiting-then-will seem so worth
I shall impute with half a pain
The blame that I was chosen-then-
Time to anticipate His Gaze-
It's first-Delight-and then-Surprise-
The turning o'er and o'er my face
For Evidence it be the Grace-
He left behind One Day-So less
He seek Conviction, That-be This-
I only must not grow so new
That He'll mistake-and ask for me
Of me-when first unto the Door
I go-to Elsewhere go no more-
I only must not change so fair
He'll sigh-"The Other-She-is Where?"
The Love, tho', will array me right
I shall be perfect-in His sight-
If He perceive the other Truth-
Upon an Excellenter Youth-
How sweet I shall not lack in Vain-
But gain-thro' loss-Through Grief-obtain-
The Beauty that reward Him best-
The Beauty of Demand-at Rest-
$Flowers—Well—if anybody
137
Flowers—Well—if anybody
Can the ecstasy define—
Half a transport—half a trouble—
With which flowers humble men:
Anybody find the fountain
From which floods so contra flow—
I will give him all the Daisies
Which upon the hillside blow.
Too much pathos in their faces
For a simple breast like mine—
Butterflies from St. Domingo
Cruising round the purple line—
Have a system of aesthetics—
Far superior to mine.
$For Death—or rather
382
For Death—or rather
For the Things 'twould buy—
This—put away
Life's Opportunity—
The Things that Death will buy
Are Room—
Escape from Circumstances—
And a Name—
With Gifts of Life
How Death's Gifts may compare—
We know not—
For the Rates—lie Here—
$For each ecstatic instant
For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay
In keen and quivering ratio
To the ectasty.
For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years,
Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears.
$For every Bird a Nest
143
For every Bird a Nest-
Wherefore in timid quest
Some little Wren goes seeking round-
Wherefore when boughs are free-
Households in every tree-
Pilgrim be found?
Perhaps a home too high-
Ah Aristocracy!
The little Wren desires-
Perhaps of twig so fine-
Of twine e'en superfine,
Her pride aspires-
The Lark is not ashamed
To build upon the ground
Her modest house-
Yet who of all the throng
Dancing around the sun
Does so rejoice?
$For largest Woman's Hearth I knew
309
For largest Woman's Hearth I knew-
'Tis little I can do-
And yet the largest Woman's Heart
Could hold an Arrow-too-
And so, instructed by my own,
I tenderer, turn Me to.
$For this—accepted Breath
195
For this—accepted Breath—
Through it—compete with Death—
The fellow cannot touch this Crown—
By it—my title take—
Ah, what a royal sake
To my necessity—stooped down!
No Wilderness—can be
Where this attendeth me—
No Desert Noon—
No fear of frost to come
Haunt the perennial bloom—
But Certain June!
Get Gabriel—to tell—the royal syllable—
Get Saints—with new—unsteady tongue—
To say what trance below
Most like their glory show—
Fittest the Crown!
$Forever at His side to walk
246
Forever at His side to walk-
The smaller of the two!
Brain of His Brain-
Blood of His Blood-
Two lives-One Being-now-
Forever of His fate to taste-
If grief-the largest part-
If joy-to put my piece away
For that beloved Heart-
All life-to know each other-
Whom we can never learn-
And bye and bye-a Change-
Called Heaven-
Rapt Neighborhoods of Men-
Just finding out-what puzzled us-
Without the lexicon!
$Forever—it composed of Nows

'Tis not a different time—
Except for Infiniteness—
And Latitude of Home—
From this—experienced Here—
Remove the Dates—to These—
Let Months dissolve in further Months—
And Years—exhale in Years—
Without Debate—or Pause—
Or Celebrated Days—
No different Our Years would be
From Anno Domini's—
$Forget! The lady with the Amulet
438
Forget! The lady with the Amulet
Forget she wore it at her Heart
Because she breathed against
Was Treason twixt?
Deny! Did Rose her Bee-
For Privilege of Play
Or Wile of Butterfly
Or Opportunity-Her Lord away?
The lady with the Amulet-will face-
The Bee-in Mausoleum laid-
Discard his Bride-
But longer than the little Rill-
That cooled the Forehead of the Hill-
While Other-went the Sea to fill-
And Other-went to turn the Mill-
I'll do thy Will-

Four Trees—upon a solitary Acre—

The Wind—
No nearer Neighbor—have they—
But God—
The Acre gives them—Place—

Of Shadow, or of Squirrel, haply—
Or Boy—

$Frequently the wood are pink
6
Frequently the wood are pink-
Frequently are brown.
Frequently the hills undress
Behind my native town.
Oft a head is crested
I was wont to see-
And as oft a cranny
Where it used to be-
And the Earth- they tell me-
On its Axis turned!
Wonderful Rotation!
By but twelve performed!
$From Blank to Blank
761
From Blank to Blank-
A Threadless Way
I pushed Mechanic feet-
To stop-or perish-or advance-
Alike indifferent-
If end I gained
It ends beyond
Indefinite disclosed-
I shut my eyes-and groped as well
'Twas lighter-to be Blind-
$From Cocoon forth a Butterfly
354
From Cocoon forth a Butterfly
As Lady from her Door
Emerged-a Summer Afternoon-
Repairing Everywhere-
Without Design-that I could trace
Except to stray abroad
On Miscellaneous Enterprise
The Clovers-understood-
Her pretty Parasol be seen
Contracting in a Field
Where Men made Hay-
Then struggling hard
With an opposing Cloud-
Where Parties-Phantom as Herself-
To Nowhere-seemed to go
In purposeless Circumference-
As 'twere a Tropic Show-
And notwithstanding Bee-that worked-
And Flower-that zealous blew-
This Audience of Idleness
Disdained them, from the Sky-
Till Sundown crept-a steady Tide-
And Men that made the Hay-
And Afternoon-and Butterfly-
Extinguished-in the Sea-
$From Us She wandered now a Year
890
From Us She wandered now a Year,

If Wilderness prevent her feet
Or that Ethereal Zone
No eye hath seen and lived
We ignorant must be-
We only know what time of Year
We took the Mystery.
$Funny—to be a Century

This Bashful Globe of Ours would be—
So dainty of Publicity—
$Further in Summer than the Birds
1068
Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
Its unobtrusive Mass.
No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness.
Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify
Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on the Glow
Yet a Druidic Difference
Enhances Nature now
$Garland for Queens, may be

Of soul or sword.

Then a softness—suffuse the Story—
And a silence—the Teller's eye—
And the Children—no further question—
And only the Sea—reply—
$Glowing is her Bonnet
72
Glowing is her Bonnet,
Glowing is her Cheek,
Glowing is her Kirtle,
Yet she cannot speak.
Better as the Daisy
From the Summer hill
Vanish unrecorded
Save by tearful rill-
Save by loving sunrise
Looking for her face.
Save by feet unnumbered
Pausing at the place.
$God gave a loaf to every bird,
God gave a loaf to every bird,
But just a crumb to me;
I dare not eat it, though I starve,--
My poignant luxury
To own it, touch it, prove the feat
That made the pellet mine,--
Too happy in my sparrow chance
For ampler coveting.
It might be famine all around,
I could not miss an ear,
Such plenty smiles upon my board,
My garner shows so fair.
I wonder how the rich may feel,--
An Indiaman--an Earl?
I deem that I with but a crumb
Am sovereign of them all.
$God is a distant—stately Lover
357
God is a distant—stately Lover—
Woos, as He states us—by His Son—
Verily, a Vicarious Courtship—
"Miles", and "Priscilla", were such an One—
But, lest the Soul—like fair "Priscilla"
Choose the Envoy—and spurn the Groom—
Vouches, with hyperbolic archness—
"Miles", and "John Alden" were Synonym—
$God made a little Gentian
442
God made a little Gentian-
It tried-to be a Rose-
And failed-and all the Summer laughed-
But just before the Snows
There rose a Purple Creature-
That ravished all the Hill-
And Summer hid her Forehead-
And Mockery-was still-
The Frosts were her condition-
The Tyrian would not come
Until the North-invoke it-
Creator-Shall I-bloom?
$God permit industrious angels

Afternoons to play.

After playing the Crown!
$Going to Heaven!

Going to Heaven!
I don't know when-
Pray do not ask me how!
Indeed I'm too astonished
To think of answering you!
Going to Heaven!
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the Shepherd's arm!
Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first
Save just a little space for me
Close to the two I lost-
The smallest "Robe" will fit me
And just a bit of "Crown"-
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home-
I'm glad I don't believe it
For it would stop my breath-
And I'd like to look a little more
At such a curious Earth!
I'm glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the might Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.
$Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him--
Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him--
Tell him the page I didn't write;
Tell him I only said the syntax,
And left the verb and the pronoun out.
Tell him just how the fingers hurried
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow-
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
So you could see what moved them so.
'Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
As if it held but the might of a child;
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.
Tell him--No, you may quibble there,
For it would split his heart to know it,
And then you and I were silenter.
'Tell him night finished before we finished
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended--
What could it hinder so, to say?
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious
But if he ask where you are hid
Until to-morrow,--happy letter!
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!'

Good night! which put the candle out?
A jealous zephyr, not a doubt.
Ah! friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The angels labored diligent;
Extinguished, now, for you!
It might have been the lighthouse spark
Some sailor, rowing in the dark,
Had importuned to see!
It might have been the waning lamp
That lit the drummer from the camp
To purer reveille!

Not too dull-

And chooses Wainscot in the Breast
For His Shy House-
And baffles quest-
Grief is a Thief-quick startled-

Of that Vast Dark-
That swept His Being-back-
Grief is a Juggler-boldest at the Play-
Lest if He flinch-the eye that way
Pounce on His Bruises-One-say-or Three-
Grief is a Gourmand-spare His luxury-
Best Grief is Tongueless-before He'll tell-

Since a Rack couldn't coax a syllable-now.

In Moment of Reverse-
"And yet Thou art industrious-
No need-hadst Thou-of us"?
My need-was all I had-I said-
The need did not reduce-
Because the food-exterminate-

But diligence-is sharper-
Proportioned to the Chance-
To feed upon the Retrograde-

A Favor so remote-

In further Infinite-
'Tis failure-not of Hope-
But Confident Despair-

Have you got a Brook in your little heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so-
And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That any brook is there,
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there-
Why, look out for the little brook in March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the fills,
And the bridges often go-
And later, in August it may be-
When the meadows parching lie,
Beware, lest this little brook of life,
Some burning noon go dry!
$He forgot—and I—remembered
203
He forgot—and I—remembered—
'Twas an everyday affair—
Long ago as Christ and Peter—
"Warmed them" at the "Temple fire."
"Thou wert with him"—quoth "the Damsel"?
"No"—said Peter, 'twasn't me—
Jesus merely "looked" at Peter—
Could I do aught else—to Thee?
$He fought like those Who've nought to lose
759
He fought like those Who've nought to lose-
Bestowed Himself to Balls
As One who for a further Life
Had not a further Use-
Invited Death-with bold attempt-
But Death was Coy of Him
As Other Men, were Coy of Death-
To Him-to live-was Doom-
His Comrades, shifted like the Flakes
When Gusts reverse the Snow-
But He-was left alive Because
Of Greediness to die-
$He found my Being—set it up
603
He found my Being—set it up—
Adjusted it to place—
Then carved his name—upon it—
And bade it to the East
Be faithful—in his absence—
And he would come again—
With Equipage of Amber—
That time—to take it Home—
$He fumbles at your Soul
315
He fumbles at your Soul
As Players at the Keys
Before they drop full Music on-
He stuns you by degrees-
Prepares your brittle Nature
For the Ethereal Blow
By fainter Hammers-further heard-
Then nearer-Then so slow
Your Breath has time to straighten-
Your Brain-to bubble Cool-
Deals-One-imperial-Thunderbolt-
That scalps your naked Soul-
When Winds take Forests in the Paws-
The Universe-is still-
$He fumbles at your spirit
He fumbles at your spirit
As players at the keys
Before they drop full music on;
He stuns you by degrees,
Prepares your brittle substance
For the ethereal blow,
By fainter hammers, further heard,
Then nearer, then so slow
Your breath has time to straighten,
Your brain to bubble cool, --
Deals one imperial thunderbolt
That scalps your naked soul.
$He gave away his Life
567
He gave away his Life-
To Us-Gigantic Sum-
A trifle-in his own esteem-
But magnified-by Fame-
Until it burst the Hearts
That fancied they could hold-
When swift it slipped its limit-
And on the Heavens-unrolled-
'Tis Ours-to wince-and weep-
And wonder-and decay
By Blossoms gradual process-
He chose-Maturity-
And quickening-as we sowed-
Just obviated Bud-
And when We turned to note the Growth-
Broke-perfect-from the Pod-
$He outstripped Time with but a Bout
865
He outstripped Time with but a Bout,
He outstripped Stars and Sun
And then, unjaded, challenged God
In presence of the Throne.
And He and He in mighty List
Unto this present, run,
The larger Glory for the less
A just sufficient Ring.
$He parts Himself—like Leaves
517
He parts Himself—like Leaves—
And then—He closes up—
Then stands upon the Bonnet
Of Any Buttercup—
And then He runs against
And oversets a Rose—
And then does Nothing—
Then away upon a Jib—He goes—
And dangles like a Mote
Suspended in the Noon—
Uncertain—to return Below—
Or settle in the Moon—
What come of Him—at Night—
The privilege to say
Be limited by Ignorance—
What come of Him—That Day—
The Frost—possess the World—
In Cabinets—be shown—
A Sepulchre of quaintest Floss—
An Abbey—a Cocoon—
$He put the Belt around my life
273
He put the Belt around my life
I heard the Buckle snap-
And turned away, imperial,
My Lifetime folding up-
Deliberate, as a Duke would do
A Kingdom's Title Deed-
Henceforth, a Dedicated sort-
A Member of the Cloud.
Yet not too far to come at call-
And do the little Toils
That make the Circuit of the Rest-
And deal occasional smiles
To lives that stoop to notice mine-
And kindly ask it in-
Whose invitation, know you not
For Whom I must decline?
$He strained my faith
497
He strained my faith-
Did he find it supple?
Shook my strong trust-
Did it then-yield?
Hurled my belief-
But-did he shatter-it?
Racked-with suspense-
Not a nerve failed!
Wrung me-with Anguish-
But I never doubted him-
'Tho' for what wrong
He did never say-
Stabbed-while I sued
His sweet forgiveness-
Jesus-it's your little "John"!
Don't you know-me?
$He told a homely tale
763
He told a homely tale
And spotted it with tears-
Upon his infant face was set
The Cicatrice of years-
All crumpled was the cheek
No other kiss had known
Than flake of snow, divided with
The Redbreast of the Barn-
If Mother-in the Grave-
Or Father-on the Sea-
Or Father in the Firmament-
Or Brethren, had he-
If Commonwealth below,
Or Commonwealth above
Have missed a Barefoot Citizen-
I've ransomed it-alive-
$He touched me, so I live to know
506
He touched me, so I live to know
That such a day, permitted so,
I groped upon his breast-
It was a boundless place to me
And silenced, as the awful sea
Puts minor streams to rest.
And now, I'm different from before,
As if I breathed superior air-
Or brushed a Royal Gown-
My feet, too, that had wandered so-
My Gypsy face-transfigured now-
To tenderer Renown-
Into this Port, if I might come,
Rebecca, to Jerusalem,
Would not so ravished turn-
Nor Persian, baffled at her shrine
Lift such a Crucifixial sign
To her imperial Sun.
$He was weak, and I was strong—then
190
He was weak, and I was strong—then—
So He let me lead him in—
I was weak, and He was strong then—
So I let him lead me—Home.
'Twasn't far—the door was near—
'Twasn't dark—for He went—too—
'Twasn't loud, for He said nought—
That was all I cared to know.
Day knocked—and we must part—
Neither—was strongest—now—
He strove—and I strove—too—
We didn't do it—tho'!
$He who in Himself believes
969
He who in Himself believes-
Fraud cannot presume-
Faith is Constancy's Result-
And assumes-from Home-
Cannot perish, though it fail
Every second time-
But defaced Vicariously-
For Some Other Shame-
$Heart! We will forget him!
47
Heart! We will forget him!
You and I-tonight!
You may forget the warmth he gave-
I will forget the light!
When you have done, pray tell me
That I may straight begin!
Haste! lest while you're lagging
I remember him!
$Heart, not so heavy as mine
83
Heart, not so heavy as mine
Wending late home-
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune-
A careless snatch-a ballad-A ditty of the street-
Yet to my irritated Ear
An Anodyne so sweet-
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused, and carolled-
Then bubbled slow away!
It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a dusty way-
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why!
Tomorrow, night will come again-
Perhaps, weary and sore-
Ah Bugle! By my window
I pray you pass once more.
$Heart, We Will Forget Him
Heart, we will forget him,
You and I, tonight!
You must forget the warmth he gave,
I will forget the light.
When you have done pray tell me,
Then I, my thoughts, will dim.
Haste! ‘lest while you’re lagging
I may remember him!
$Heaven
575
"Heaven" has different Signs—to me—
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place—
And when again, at Dawn,
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills—
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals—
The Orchard, when the Sun is on—
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make—
Some Carnivals of Clouds—
The Rapture of a finished Day—
Returning to the West—
All these—remind us of the place
That Men call "paradise"—
Itself be fairer—we suppose—
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace—
Not yet, our eyes can see—
$Heaven has different Signs—to me

$Heaven is so far of the Mind
370
Heaven is so far of the Mind
That were the Mind dissolved-
The Site-of it-by Architect
Could not again be proved-
'Tis vast-as our Capacity-
As fair-as our idea-
To Him of adequate desire
No further 'tis, than Here-
$Heaven is what I cannot reach!
Heaven is what I cannot reach!
The apple on the tree,
Provided it do hopelss hang,
That 'heaven' is, to me.
The color on the cruising cloud,
The interdicted ground
Behind the hill, the house behind, --
There Paradise is found!
$Her—
312
Her—"last Poems"—
Poets—ended—
Silver—perished—with her Tongue—
Not on Record—bubbled other,
Flute—or Woman—
So divine—
Not unto its Summer—Morning
Robin—uttered Half the Tune—
Gushed too free for the Adoring—
From the Anglo-Florentine—
Late—the Praise—
'Tis dull—conferring
On the Head too High to Crown—
Diadem—or Ducal Showing—
Be its Grave—sufficient sign—
Nought—that We—No Poet's Kinsman—
Suffocate—with easy woe—
What, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom—
Put Her down—in Italy?
$Her breast is fit for pearls
84
Her breast is fit for pearls,
But I was not a "Diver"-
Her brow is fit for thrones
But I have not a crest.
Her heart is fit for home-
I-a Sparrow-build there
Sweet of twigs and twine
My perennial nest.
$Her final summer was it,
Her final summer was it,
And yet we guessed it not;
If tenderer industriousness
Pervaded her, we thought
A further force of life
Developed from within,--
When Death lit all the shortness up,
And made the hurry plain.
We wondered at our blindness,--
When nothing was to see
But her Carrara guide-post,--
At our stupidity
When, duller than our dulness,
The busy darling lay,
So busy was she, finishing,
So leisurely were we!
$Her Grace is all she has-
810
Her Grace is all she has-
And that, so least displays-
One Art to recognize, must be,
Another Art, to praise.
$Her smile was shaped like other smiles
514
Her smile was shaped like other smiles-
The Dimples ran along-
And still it hurt you, as some Bird
Did hoist herself, to sing,
Then recollect a Ball, she got-
And hold upon the Twig,
Convulsive, while the Music broke-
Like Beads-among the Bog-
$Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
649
Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
Came the Darker Way-
Carriages-Be Sure-and Guests-too-
But for Holiday
'Tis more pitiful Endeavor
Than did Loaded Sea
O'er the Curls attempt to caper
It had cast away-
Never Bride had such Assembling-
Never kinsmen kneeled
To salute so fair a Forehead-
Garland be indeed-
Fitter Feet-of Her before us-
Than whatever Brow
Art of Snow-or Trick of Lily
Possibly bestow
Of Her Father-Whoso ask Her-
He shall seek as high
As the Palm-that serve the Desert-
To obtain the Sky-
Distance-be Her only Motion-
If 'tis Nay-or Yes-
Acquiescence-or Demurral-
Whosoever guess-
He-must pass the Crystal Angle
That obscure Her face-
He-must have achieved in person
Equal Paradise-
$Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night
518
Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night
Had scarcely deigned to lie-
When, stirring, for Belief's delight,
My Bride had slipped away-
If 'twas a Dream-made solid-just
The Heaven to confirm-
Or if Myself were dreamed of Her-
The power to presume-
With Him remain-who unto Me-
Gave-even as to All-
A Fiction superseding Faith-
By so much-as 'twas real-
$Her-"last Poems"

Poets-ended-

Not on Record-bubbled other,

Gushed too free for the Adoring-
From the Anglo-Florentine-

Herein a Blossom lies-
A Sepulchre, between-
Cross it, and overcome the Bee-
Remain-'tis but a Rind.
$His Bill an Auger is
1034
His Bill an Auger is,
His Head, a Cap and Frill.
He laboreth at every Tree
A Worm, His utmost Goal.
$His Feet are shod with Gauze
916
His Feet are shod with Gauze-
His Helmet, is of Gold,
His Breast, a Single Onyx
With Chrysophrase, inlaid.
His Labor is a Chant-
His Idleness-a Tune-
Oh, for a Bee's experience
Of Clovers, and of Noon!
$Home
Years I had been from home,
And now, before the door
I dared not open, lest a face
I never saw before
Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there.
My business, - just a life I left,
Was such still dwelling there?
I fumbled at my nerve,
I scanned the windows near;
The silence like an ocean rolled,
And broke against my ear.
I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door,
Who danger and the dead had faced,
But never quaked before.
I fitted to the latch
My hand, with trembling care,
Lest back the awful door should spring,
And leave me standing there.
I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass,
And held my ears, and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house.
$Hope is the thing with feathers
Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.
I've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.
$Houses—so the Wise Men tell me—
"Houses"—so the Wise Men tell me—
"Mansions"! Mansions must be warm!
Mansions cannot let the tears in,
Mansions must exclude the storm!
"Many Mansions," by "his Father,"
I don't know him; snugly built!
Could the Children find the way there—
Some, would even trudge tonight!
$How far is it to Heaven?
929
How far is it to Heaven?
As far as Death this way-
Of River or of Ridge beyond
Was no discovery.
How far is it to Hell?
As far as Death this way-
How far left hand the Sepulchre
Defies Topography.
$How fortunate the Grave
897
How fortunate the Grave-
All Prizes to obtain-
Successful certain, if at last,
First Suitor not in vain.
$How happy I was if I could forget
898
How happy I was if I could forget
To remember how sad I am
Would be an easy adversity
But the recollecting of Bloom
Keeps making November difficult
Till I who was almost bold
Lose my way like a little Child
And perish of the cold.
$How happy is the little Stone
1510
How happy is the little Stone
That rambles in the Road alone,
And doesn't care about Careers
And Exigencies never fears-
Whose Coat of elemental Brown
A passing Universe put on,
And independent as the Sun
Associates or glows alone,
Fulfilling absolute Decree
In casual simplicity-
$How many Flowers fail in Wood
404
How many Flowers fail in Wood-
Or perish from the Hill-
Without the privilege to know
That they are Beautiful-
How many cast a nameless Pod
Upon the nearest Breeze-
Unconscious of the Scarlet Freight-
It bear to Other Eyes-
$How many times these low feet staggered
187
How many times these low feet staggered-
Only the soldered mouth can tell-
Try-can you stir the awful rivet-
Try-can you lift the hasps of steel!
Stroke the cool forehead-hot so often-
Lift-if you care-the listless hair-
Handle the adamantine fingers
Never a thimble-more-shall wear-
Buzz the dull flies-on the chamber window-
Brave-shines the sun through the freckled pane-
Fearless-the cobweb swings from the ceiling-
Indolent Housewife-in Daisies-lain!
$How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand
282
How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand,
Until a sudden sky
Reveals the fact that One is rapt
Forever from the Eye-
Members of the Invisible,
Existing, while we stare,
In Leagueless Opportunity,
O'ertakenless, as the Air-
Why didn't we detain Them?
The Heavens with a smile,
Sweep by our disappointed Heads
Without a syllable-
$How sick—to wait—in any place—but thine
368
How sick—to wait—in any place—but thine—
I knew last night—when someone tried to twine—
Thinking—perhaps—that I looked tired—or alone—
Or breaking—almost—with unspoken pain—
And I turned—ducal—
That right—was thine—
One port—suffices—for a Brig—like mine—
Ours be the tossing—wild though the sea—
Rather than a Mooring—unshared by thee.
Ours be the Cargo—unladed—here—
Rather than the "spicy isles—"
And thou—not there—
$How the old Mountains drip with Sunset
291
How the old Mountains drip with Sunset
How the Hemlocks burn-
How the Dun Brake is draped in Cinder
By the Wizard Sun-
How the old Steeples hand the Scarlet
Till the Ball is full-
Have I the lip of the Flamingo
That I dare to tell?
Then, how the Fire ebbs like Billows-
Touching all the Grass
With a departing-Sapphire-feature-
As a Duchess passed-
How a small Dusk crawls on the Village
Till the Houses blot
And the odd Flambeau, no men carry
Glimmer on the Street-
How it is Night-in Nest and Kennel-
And where was the Wood-
Just a Dome of Abyss is Bowing
Into Solitude-
These are the Visions flitted Guido-
Titian-never told-
Domenichino dropped his pencil-
Paralyzed, with Gold-
$How the Waters closed above Him
923
How the Waters closed above Him
We shall never know-
How He stretched His Anguish to us
That-is covered too-
Spreads the Pond Her Base of Lilies
Bold above the Boy
Whose unclaimed Hat and Jacket
Sum the History-

A Bounty in prospective, now
Next Door to mine the Pain.

I am alive—I guess—
The Branches on my Hand
Are full of Morning Glory—
And at my finger's end—
The Carmine—tingles warm—
And if I hold a Glass
Across my Mouth—it blurs it—
Physician's—proof of Breath—
I am alive—because
I am not in a Room—
The Parlor—Commonly—it is—
So Visitors may come—
And lean—and view it sidewise—
And add "How cold—it grew"—
And "Was it conscious—when it stepped
In Immortality?"
I am alive—because
I do not own a House—
Entitled to myself—precise—
And fitting no one else—
And marked my Girlhood's name—
So Visitors may know
Which Door is mine—and not

I am ashamed—I hide—
What right have I—to be a Bride—
So late a Dowerless Girl—
Nowhere to hide my dazzled Face—
No one to teach me that new Grace—
Nor introduce—my Soul—
Me to adorn—How—tell—
Trinket—to make Me beautiful—
Fabrics of Cashmere—
Never a Gown of Dun—more—
Raiment instead—of Pompadour—
For Me—My soul—to wear—
Fingers—to frame my Round Hair
Oval—as Feudal Ladies wore—

Skill to hold my Brow like an Earl—
Plead—like a Whippoorwill—

Quick—like a Liquor—
Gay—like Light—
Bring Me my best Pride—
No more ashamed—
No more to hide—
Meek—let it be—too proud—for Pride—
Baptized—this Day—a Bride—

I asked no other thing-
No other-was denied-
I offered Being-for it-
The Mighty Merchant sneered-
Brazil? He twirled a Button-
Without a glance my way-
"But-Madam-is there nothing else-
That We can show-Today?"
$I breathed enough to learn the trick,
I breathed enough to learn the trick,
And now, removed from air,

Among the cunning cells,
And touch the pantomime himself.
How cool the bellows feels!
$I bring an unaccustomed wine
132
I bring an unaccustomed wine
To lips long parching
Next to mine,
And summon them to drink;
Crackling with fever, they Essay,
I turn my brimming eyes away,
And come next hour to look.
The hands still hug the tardy glass-
The lips I would have cooled, alas-
Are so superfluous Cold-
I would as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Ages beneath the mould-
Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this would have pointed me
Had it remained to speak-
And so I always bear the cup
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Some pilgrim thirst to slake-
If, haply, any say to me
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.
$I Came to buy a smile—today
223
I Came to buy a smile—today—
But just a single smile—
The smallest one upon your face
Will suit me just as well—
The one that no one else would miss
It shone so very small—
I'm pleading at the "counter"—sir—
Could you afford to sell—
I've Diamonds—on my fingers—
You know what Diamonds are?
I've Rubies—live the Evening Blood—
And Topaz—like the star!
'Twould be "a Bargain" for a Jew!
Say—may I have it—Sir?

Whole Pools of it-
I'm used to that-
But the least push of Joy
Breaks up my feet-
And I tip-drunken-
Let no Pebble-smile-
'Twas the New Liquor-
That was all!
Power is only Pain-
Stranded, thro' Discipline,
Till Weights-will hang-
Give Balm-to Giants-
And they'll wilt, like Men-
Give Himmaleh-
They'll Carry-Him!
$I cannot be ashamed

I cannot be ashamed

And I cannot be proud
Because a Height so high
Involves Alpine

840
I cannot buy it—'tis not sold—
There is no other in the World—
Mine was the only one
I was so happy I forgot
To shut the Door And it went out
And I am all alone—
If I could find it Anywhere
I would not mind the journey there
Though it took all my store
But just to look it in the Eye—
"Did'st thou?" "Thou did'st not mean," to say,
Then, turn my Face away.
$I cannot dance upon my Toes
326
I cannot dance upon my Toes-
No Man instructed me-
But oftentimes, among my mind,
A Glee possesseth me,
That had I Ballet knowledge-
Would put itself abroad
In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe-
Or lay a Prima, mad,
And though I had no Gown of Gauze-
No Ringlet, to my Hair,
Nor hopped to Audiences-like Birds,
One Claw upon the Air,
Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls,
Nor rolled on wheels of snow
Till I was out of sight, in sound,
The House encore me so-
Nor any know I know the Art
I mention-easy-Here-
Nor any Placard boast me-
It's full as Opera-

Putting up

Like a Cup--
Discarded of the Housewife--
Quaint--or Broke--

Old Ones crack--
I could not die--with You--
For One must wait
To shut the Other's Gaze down--
You--could not--
And I--could I stand by
And see You--freeze--
Without my Right of Frost--
Death's privilege?
Nor could I rise--with You--
Because Your Face
Would put out Jesus'--
That New Grace
Glow plain--and foreign
On my homesick Eye--
Except that You than He
Shone closer by--
They'd judge Us--How--
For You--served Heaven--You know,
Or sought to--
I could not--
Because You saturated Sight--
And I had no more Eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise
And were You lost, I would be--
Though My Name

On the Heavenly fame--
And were You--saved--
And I--condemned to be

Sweeter than a vanished frolic
From a vanished green!
Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen
Round a Ledge of dream!
Modest, let us walk among it
With our faces veiled—
As they say polite Archangels
Do in meeting God!
Not for me—to prate about it!
Not for you—to say
To some fashionable Lady
"Charming April Day"!
Rather—Heaven's "Peter Parley"!
By which Children slow
To sublimer Recitation
Are prepared to go!

I cautious, scanned my little life-
I winnowed what would fade
From what would last till Heads like mine
Should be a-dreaming laid.
I put the latter in a Barn-
The former, blew away.
I went one winter morning
And lo - my priceless Hay
Was not upon the "Scaffold"-
Was not upon the "Beam"-
And from a thriving Farmer-
A Cynic, I became.
Whether a Thief did it-
Whether it was the wind-
Whether Deity's guiltless-
My business is, to find!
So I begin to ransack!
How is it Hearts, with Thee?
Art thou within the little Barn
Love provided Thee?

Flickering to itself—in the Meadow—
Suits Me—more than those—
Never a Fellow matched this Topaz—
And his Emerald Swing—
Dower itself—for Bobadilo—
Better—Could I bring?
$I could die—to know
570
I could die—to know—
'Tis a trifling knowledge—
News-Boys salute the Door—
Carts—joggle by—
Morning's bold face—stares in the window—
Were but mine—the Charter of the least Fly—
Houses hunch the House
With their Brick Shoulders—
Coals—from a Rolling Load—rattle—how—near—
To the very Square—His foot is passing—
Possibly, this moment—
While I—dream—Here—
$I could not drink it, Sweet
818
I could not drink it, Sweet,
Till You had tasted first,
Though cooler than the Water was
The Thoughtfullness of Thirst.
$I could not prove the Years had feet
563
I could not prove the Years had feet-
Yet confident they run
Am I, from symptoms that are past
And Series that are done-
I find my feet have further Goals-
I smile upon the Aims
That felt so ample-Yesterday-
Today's-have vaster claims-
I do not doubt the self I was
Was competent to me-
But something awkward in the fit-
Proves that-outgrown-I see-
$I could suffice for Him, I knew
643
I could suffice for Him, I knew-
He-could suffice for Me-
Yet Hesitating Fractions-Both
Surveyed Infinity-
"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached-
My syllable rebelled-
'Twas face to face with Nature-forced-
'Twas face to face with God-
Withdrew the Sun-to Other Wests-
Withdrew the furthest Star
Before Decision-stooped to speech-
And then-be audibler
The Answer of the Sea unto
The Motion of the Moon-
Herself adjust Her Tides-unto-
Could I-do else-with Mine?
$I cried at Pity—not at Pain
588
I cried at Pity—not at Pain—
I heard a Woman say
"Poor Child"—and something in her voice
Convicted me—of me—
So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things—
To look at, like a Toy—
To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolled—
And carried, I supposed—to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold—
But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh—
And so and so—had been to me,
Had God willed differently.
I wish I knew that Woman's name—
So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say
She's "sorry I am dead"—again—
Just when the Grave and I—
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our only Lullaby—
$I cross till I am weary
550
I cross till I am weary
A Mountain-in my mind-
More Mountains-then a Sea-
More Seas-And then
A Desert-find-
And My Horizon blocks
With steady-drifting-Grains
Of unconjectured quantity-
As Asiatic Rains-
Nor this-defeat my Pace-
It hinder from the West
But as an Enemy's Salute
One hurrying to Rest-
What merit had the Goal-
Except there intervene
Faint Doubt-and far Competitor-
To jeopardize the Gain?
At last-the Grace in sight-
I shout unto my feet-
I offer them the Whole of Heaven
The instant that we meet-
They strive-and yet delay-
They perish-Do we die-
Or is this Death's Experiment-
Reversed-in Victory?
$I Died For Beauty
I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
He questioned softly why I failed?
"For beauty," I replied.
"And I for truth - the two are one;
We brethren are," he said.
And so, as kinsmen met a-night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.
$I died for beauty but was scarce
I died for beauty but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
He questioned softly why I failed?
'For beauty,' I replied.
'And I for truth,--the two are one;
We brethren are,' he said.
And so, as kinsmen met a night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.
$I dreaded that first Robin, so
348
I dreaded that first Robin, so,
But He is mastered, now,
I'm accustomed to Him grown,
He hurts a little, though-
I thought If I could only live
Till that first Shout got by-
Not all Pianos in the Woods
Had power to mangle me-
I dared not meet the Daffodils-
For fear their Yellow Gown
Would pierce me with a fashion
So foreign to my own-
I wished the Grass would hurry-
So-when 'twas time to see-
He'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch-to look at me-
I could not bear the Bees should come,
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go,
What word had they, for me?
They're here, though; not a creature failed-
No Blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me-
The Queen of Calvary-
Each one salutes me, as he goes,
And I, my childish Plumes,
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthinking Drums-
$I dwell in Possibility
657
I dwell in Possibility-
A fairer House than Prose-
More numerous of Windows-
Superior-for Doors-
Of Chambers as the Cedars-
Impregnable of Eye-
And for an Everlasting Roof
The Gambrels of the Sky-
Of Visitors-the fairest-
For Occupation-This-
The spreading wide of narrow Hands
To gather Paradise-
$I envy Seas, whereon He rides
498
I envy Seas, whereon He rides-
I envy Spokes of Wheels
Of Chariots, that Him convey-
I envy Crooked Hills
That gaze upon His journey-
How easy All can see
What is forbidden utterly
As Heaven-unto me!
I envy Nests of Sparrows-
That dot His distant Eaves-
The wealthy Fly, upon His Pane-
The happy-happy Leaves-
That just abroad His Window
Have Summer's leave to play-
The Ear Rings of Pizarro
Could not obtain for me-
I envy Light-that wakes Him-
And Bells-that boldly ring
To tell Him it is Noon, abroad-
Myself-be Noon to Him-
Yet interdict-my Blossom-
And abrogate-my Bee-
Lest Noon in Everlasting Night-
Drop Gabriel-and Me-
$I fear a Man of frugal Speech
543
I fear a Man of frugal Speech-
I fear a Silent Man-
Haranguer-I can overtake-
Or Babbler-entertain-
But He who weigheth-While the Rest-
Expend their furthest pound-
Of this Man-I am wary-
I fear that He is Grand-
$I felt a cleaving in my mind
I felt a cleaving in my mind
As if my brain had split;
I tried to match it, seam by seam,
But could not make them fit.
The thought behind I strove to join
Unto the thought before,
But sequence ravelled out of reach
Like balls upon a floor.
$I felt a Funeral, in my Brain (280)
I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading--treading--till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through--
And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum--
Kept beating--beating--till I thought
My Mind was going numb--
And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space--began to toll,
As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race
Wrecked, solitary, here--
And
And
And
And
then a Plank in Reason, broke,
I dropped down, and down--
hit a World, at every plunge,
Finished knowing--then--
$I felt my life with both my hands
351
I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there-
I held my spirit to the Glass,
To prove it possibler-
I turned my Being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the Owner's name-
For doubt, that I should know the Sound-
I judged my features-jarred my hair-
I pushed my dimples by, and waited-
If they-twinkled back-
Conviction might, of me-
I told myself, "Take Courage, Friend-
That-was a former time-
But we might learn to like the Heaven,
As well as our Old Home!"
$I found the phrase to every thought
I found the phrase to every thought
I ever had, but one;
And that defies me,--as a hand
Did try to chalk the sun
To races nurtured in the dark;--
How would your own begin?
Can blaze be done in cochineal,
Or noon in mazarin?
$I gained it so
359
I gained it so-
By Climbing slow-
By Catching at the Twigs that grow
Between the Bliss-and me-
It hung so high
As well the Sky
Attempt by Strategy-
I said I gained it-
This-was all-
Look, how I clutch it
Lest it fall-
And I a Pauper go-
Unfitted by an instant's Grace
For the Contented-Beggar's face
I wore-an hour ago-
$I gave myself to Him
580
I gave myself to Him-
And took Himself, for Pay,
The solemn contract of a Life
Was ratified, this way-
The Wealth might disappoint-
Myself a poorer prove
Than this great Purchaser suspect,
The Daily Own-of Love
Depreciate the Vision-
But till the Merchant buy-
Still Fable-in the Isles of Spice-
The subtle Cargoes-lie-
At least-'tis Mutual-Risk-
Some-found it-Mutual Gain-
Sweet Debt of Life-Each Night to owe-
Insolvent-every Noon-
$I got so I could take his name
293
I got so I could take his name-
Without-Tremendous gain-
That Stop-sensation-on my Soul-
And Thunder-in the Room-
I got so I could walk across
That Angle in the floor,
Where he turned so, and I turned-how-
And all our Sinew tore-
I got so I could stir the Box-
In which his letters grew
Without that forcing, in my breath-
As Staples-driven through-
Could dimly recollect a Grace-
I think, they call it "God"-
Renowned to ease Extremity-
When Formula, had failed-
And shape my Hands-
Petition's way,
Tho' ignorant of a word
That Ordination-utters-
My Business, with the Cloud,
If any Power behind it, be,
Not subject to Despair-
It care, in some remoter way,
For so minute affair
As Misery-
Itself, too vast, for interrupting-more-
$I had a guinea golden
23
I had a guinea golden-
I lost it in the sand-
And tho' the sum was simple
And pounds were in the land-
Still, had it such a value
Unto my frugal eye-
That when I could not find it-
I sat me down to sigh.
I had a crimson Robin-
Who sang full many a day
But when the woods were painted,
He, too, did fly away-
Time brought me other Robins-
Their ballads were the same-
Still, for my missing Troubador
I kept the "house at hame."
I had a star in heaven-
One "Pleiad" was its name-
And when I was not heeding,
It wandered from the same.
And tho' the skies are crowded-
And all the night ashine-
I do not care about it-
Since none of them are mine.
My story has a moral-
I have a missing friend-
"Pleiad" its name, and Robin,
And guinea in the sand.
And when this mournful ditty
Accompanied with tear-
Shall meet the eye of traitor
In country far from here-
Grant that repentance solemn
May seize upon his mind-
And he no consolation
Beneath the sun may find.
$I had been hungry all the years-
I had been hungry all the years-
My noon had come, to dine-
I, trembling, drew the table near
And touched the curious wine.
'T was this on tables I had seen
When turning, hungry, lone,
I looked in windows, for the wealth
I could not hope to own.
I did not know the ample bread,
'T was so unlike the crumb
The birds and I had often shared
In Nature's dining-room.
The plenty hurt me, 't was so new,--
Myself felt ill and odd,
As berry of a mountain bush
Transplanted to the road.
Nor was I hungry; so I found
That hunger was a way
Of persons outside windows,
The entering takes away.
$I had no Cause to be awake
542
I had no Cause to be awake-
My Best-was gone to sleep-
And Morn a new politeness took-
And failed to wake them up-
But called the others-clear-
And passed their Curtains by-
Sweet Morning-when I oversleep-
Knock-Recollect-to Me-
I looked at Sunrise-Once-
And then I looked at Them-
And wishfulness in me arose-
For Circumstance the same-
'Twas such an Ample Peace-
It could not hold a Sigh-
'Twas Sabbath-with the Bells divorced-
'Twas Sunset-all the Day-
So choosing but a Gown-
And taking but a Prayer-
The only Raiment I should need-
I struggled-and was There-
$I had no time to Hate
478
I had no time to Hate-
Because
The Grave would hinder Me-
And Life was not so
Ample I
Could finish-Enmity-
Nor had I time to Love-
But since
Some Industry must be-
The little Toil of Love-
I thought
Be large enough for Me-
$I had no time to hate, because
I had no time to hate, because
The grave would hinder me,
And life was not so ample I
Could finish enmity.
Nor had I time to love, but since
Some industry must be,
The little toil of love, I thought,
Was large enough for me.
$I had not minded—Walls
398
I had not minded—Walls—
Were Universe—one Rock—
And fr I heard his silver Call
The other side the Block—
I'd tunnel—till my Groove
Pushed sudden thro' to his—
Then my face take her Recompense—
The looking in his Eyes—
But 'tis a single Hair—
A filament—a law—
A Cobweb—wove in Adamant—
A Battlement—of Straw—
A limit like the Veil
Unto the Lady's face—
But every Mesh—a Citadel—
And Dragons—in the Crease—
$I had some things that I called mine
116
I had some things that I called mine-
And God, that he called his,
Till, recently a rival Claim
Disturbed these amities.
The property, my garden,
Which having sown with care,
He claims the pretty acre,
And sends a Bailiff there.
The station of the parties
Forbids publicity,
But Justice is sublimer
Than arms, or pedigree.
I'll institute an "Action"-
I'll vindicate the law-
Jove! Choose your counsel-
I retain "Shaw"!
$I had the Glory—that will do
349
I had the Glory—that will do—
An Honor, Thought can turn her to
When lesser Fames invite—
With one long "Nay"—
Bliss' early shape
Deforming—Dwindling—Gulfing up—
Time's possibility.
$I have a Bird in spring
5
I have a Bird in spring
Which for myself doth sing-
The spring decoys.
And as the summer nears-
And as the Rose appears,
Robin is gone.
Yet do I not repine
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown-
Learneth beyond the sea
Melody new for me
And will return.
Fast is a safer hand
Held in a truer Land
Are mine-
And though they now depart,
Tell I my doubting heart
They're thine.
In a serener Bright,
In a more golden light
I see
Each little doubt and fear,
Each little discord here
Removed.
Then will I not repine,
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown
Shall in a distant tree
Bright melody for me
Return.
$I have a King, who does not speak
103
I have a King, who does not speak-
So-wondering-thro' the hours meek
I trudge the day away-
Half glad when it is night, and sleep,
If, haply, thro' a dream, to peep
In parlors, shut by day.
And if I do-when morning comes-
It is as if a hundred drums
Did round my pillow roll,
And shouts fill all my Childish sky,
And Bells keep saying "Victory"
From steeples in my soul!
And if I don't-the little Bird
Within the Orchard, is not heard,
And I omit to pray
"Father, thy will be done" today
For my will goes the other way,
And it were perjury!
$I have never seen
175
I have never seen "Volcanoes"—
But, when Travellers tell
How those old—phlegmatic mountains
Usually so still—
Bear within—appalling Ordnance,
Fire, and smoke, and gun,
Taking Villages for breakfast,
And appalling Men—
If the stillness is Volcanic
In the human face
When upon a pain Titanic
Features keep their place—
If at length the smouldering anguish
Will not overcome—
And the palpitating Vineyard
In the dust, be thrown?
If some loving Antiquary,
On Resumption Morn,
Will not cry with joy "Pompeii"!
To the Hills return!
$I have never seen "Volcanoes"
175
I have never seen "Volcanoes"-
But, when Travellers tell
How those old-phlegmatic mountains
Usually so still-
Bear within-appalling Ordnance,
Fire, and smoke, and gun,
Taking Villages for breakfast,
And appalling Men-
If the stillness is Volcanic
In the human face
When upon a pain Titanic
Features keep their place-
If at length the smouldering anguish
Will not overcome-
And the palpitating Vineyard
In the dust, be thrown?
If some loving Antiquary,
On Resumption Morn,
Will not cry with joy "Pompeii"!
To the Hills return!
$I haven't told my garden yet
50
I haven't told my garden yet-
Lest that should conquer me.
I haven't quite the strength now
To break it to the Bee-
I will not name it in the street
For shops would stare at me-
That one so shy-so ignorant
Should have the face to die.
The hillsides must not know it-
Where I have rambled so-
Nor tell the loving forests
The day that I shall go-
Nor lisp it at the table-
Nor heedless by the way
Hint that within the Riddle
One will walk today-
$I heard a fly buzz when I died;
I heard a fly buzz when I died;
The stillness round my form
Was like the stillness in the air
Between the heaves of storm.
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
And breaths were gathering sure
For that last onset, when the king
Be witnessed in his power.
I willed my keepsakes, signed away
What portion of me I
Could make assignable,--and then
There interposed a fly,
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
Between the light and me;
And then the windows failed, and then
I could not see to see.
$I held a Jewel in my fingers
245
I held a Jewel in my fingers-
And went to sleep-
The day was warm, and winds were prosy-
I said "'Twill keep"-
I woke-and chid my honest fingers,
The Gem was gone-
And now, an Amethyst remembrance
Is all I own-
$I hide myself within my flower
903
I hide myself within my flower,
That fading from your Vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me-
Almost a loneliness.
$I keep my pledge
46
I keep my pledge.
I was not called-
Death did not notice me.
I bring my Rose.
I plight again,
By every sainted Bee-
By Daisy called from hillside-
by Bobolink from lane.
Blossom and I-
Her oath, and mine-
Will surely come again.
$I know a place where summer strives
I know a place where summer strives
With such a practised frost,
She each year leads her daisies back,
Recording briefly, 'Lost.'
But when the south wind stirs the pools
And struggles in the lanes,
Her heart misgives her for her vow,
And she pours soft refrains
Into the lap of adamant,
And spices, and the dew,
That stiffens quietly to quartz
Upon her amber shoe.
$I know lives, I could miss
372
I know lives, I could miss
Without a Misery-
Others-whose instant's wanting-
Would be Eternity-
The last-a scanty Number-
'Twould scarcely fill a Two-
The first-a Gnat's Horizon
Could easily outgrow-
$I know some lonely Houses off the Road
289
I know some lonely Houses off the Road
A Robber'd like the look of-
Wooden barred,
And Windows hanging low,
Inviting to-
A Portico,
Where two could creep-
One-hand the Tools-
The other peep-
To make sure All's Asleep-
Old fashioned eyes-
Not easy to surprise!
How orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night,
With just a Clock-
But they could gag the Tick-
And Mice won't bark-
And so the Walls-don't tell-
None-will-
A pair of Spectacles ajar just stir-
An Almanac's aware-
Was it the Mat-winked,
Or a Nervous Star?
The Moon-slides down the stair,
To see who's there!
There's plunder-where-
Tankard, or Spoon-
Earring-or Stone-
A Watch-Some Ancient Brooch
To match the Grandmama-
Staid sleeping-there-
Day-rattles-too
Stealth's-slow-
The Sun has got as far
As the third Sycamore-
Screams Chanticleer
"Who's there"?
And Echoes-Trains away,
Sneer-"Where"!
While the old Couple, just astir,
Fancy the Sunrise-left the door ajar!
$I know that He exists
338
I know that He exists.
Somewhere-in Silence-
He has hid his rare life
From our gross eyes.
'Tis an instant's play.
'Tis a fond Ambush-
Just to make Bliss
Earn her own surprise!
But-should the play
Prove piercing earnest-
Should the glee-glaze-
In Death's-stiff-stare-
Would not the fun
Look too expensive!
Would not the jest-
Have crawled too far!
$I know where Wells grow—Droughtless Wells
460
I know where Wells grow—Droughtless Wells—
Deep dug—for Summer days—
Where Mosses go no more away—
And Pebble—safely plays—
It's made of Fathoms—and a Belt—
A Belt of jagged Stone—
Inlaid with Emerald—half way down—
And Diamonds—jumbled on—
It has no Bucket—Were I rich
A Bucket I would buy—
I'm often thirsty—but my lips
Are so high up—You see—
I read in an Old fashioned Book
That People "thirst no more"—
The Wells have Buckets to them there—
It must mean that—I'm sure—
Shall We remember Parching—then?
Those Waters sound so grand—
I think a little Well—like Mine—
Dearer to understand—
$I learned—at least—what Home could be
944
I learned—at least—what Home could be—
How ignorant I had been
Of pretty ways of Covenant—
How awkward at the Hymn
Round our new Fireside—but for this—
This pattern—of the Way—
Whose Memory drowns me, like the Dip
Of a Celestial Sea—
What Mornings in our Garden—guessed—
What Bees—for us—to hum—
With only Birds to interrupt
The Ripple of our Theme—
And Task for Both—
When Play be done—
Your Problem—of the Brain—
And mine—some foolisher effect—
A Ruffle—or a Tune—
The Afternoons—Together spent—
And Twilight—in the Lanes—
Some ministry to poorer lives—
Seen poorest—thro' our gains—
And then Return—and Night—and Home—
And then away to You to pass—
A new—diviner—care—
Till Sunrise take us back to Scene—
Transmuted—Vivider—
This seems a Home—
And Home is not—
But what that Place could be—
Afflicts me—as a Setting Sun—
Where Dawn—knows how to be—
$I like a look of Agony
241
I like a look of Agony,
Because I know it's true-
Men do not sham Convulsion,
Nor simulate, a Throe-
The Eyes glaze once-and that is Death-
Impossible to feign
The Beads upon the Forehead
By homely Anguish strung.
$I like to see it lap the miles,
I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step
Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare
To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down hill
And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop--docile and omnipotent--
At its own stable door.
$I live with Him—I see His face
463
I live with Him—I see His face—
I go no more away
For Visitor—or Sundown—
Death's single privacy
The Only One—forestalling Mine—
And that—by Right that He
Presents a Claim invisible—
No wedlock—granted Me—
I live with Him—I hear His Voice—
I stand alive—Today—
To witness to the Certainty
Of Immortality—
Taught Me—by Time—the lower Way—
Conviction—Every day—
That Life like This—is stopless—
Be Judgment—what it may—
$I lived on Dread
770
I lived on Dread-
To Those who know
The Stimulus there is
In Danger-Other impetus
Is numb-and Vitalless-
As 'twere a Spur-upon the Soul-
A Fear will urge it where
To go without the Sceptre's aid
Were Challenging Despair.
$I lived on dread; to those who know
I lived on dread; to those who know
The stimulus there is
In danger, other impetus
Is numb and vital-less.
As't were a spur upon the soul,
A fear will urge it where
To go without the spectre's aid
Were challenging despair.
$I lost a World - the other day!
181
I lost a World - the other day!
Has Anybody found?
You'll know it by the Row of Stars
Around its forehead bound.
A Rich man-might not notice it-
Yet-to my frugal Eye,
Of more Esteem than Ducats-
Oh find it-Sir-for me!
$I made slow Riches but my Gain
843
I made slow Riches but my Gain
Was steady as the Sun
And every Night, it numbered more
Than the preceding One
All Days, I did not earn the same
But my perceiveless Gain
Inferred the less by Growing than
The Sum that it had grown.
$I make His Crescent fill or lack
909
I make His Crescent fill or lack-
His Nature is at Full
Or Quarter-as I signify-
His Tides-do I control-
He holds superior in the Sky
Or gropes, at my Command
Behind inferior Clouds-or round
A Mist's slow Colonnade-
But since We hold a Mutual Disc-
And front a Mutual Day-
Which is the Despot, neither knows-
Nor Whose-the Tyranny-
$I many times thought Peace had come
739
I many times thought Peace had come
When Peace was far away-
As Wrecked Men-deem they sight the Land-
At Centre of the Sea-
And struggle slacker-but to prove
As hopelessly as I-
How many the fictitious Shores-
Before the Harbor be-
$I meant to find Her when I came
718
I meant to find Her when I came-
Death-had the same design-
But the Success-was His-it seems-
And the Surrender-Mine-
I meant to tell Her how I longed
For just this single time-
But Death had told Her so the first-
And she had past, with Him-
To wander-now-is my Repose-
To rest-To rest would be
A privilege of Hurricane
To Memory-and Me.
$I meant to have but modest needs
476
I meant to have but modest needs-
Such as Content-and Heaven-
Within my income-these could lie
And Life and I-keep even-
But since the last-included both-
It would suffice my Prayer
But just for One-to stipulate-
And Grace would grant the Pair-
And so-upon this wise-I prayed-
Great Spirit-Give to me
A Heaven not so large as Yours,
But large enough-for me-
A Smile suffused Jehovah's face-
The Cherubim-withdrew-
Grave Saints stole out to look at me-
And showed their dimples-too-
I left the Place, with all my might-
I threw my Prayer away-
The Quiet Ages picked it up-
And Judgment-twinkled-too-
Tat one so honest-be extant-
It take the Tale for true-
That "Whatsoever Ye shall ask-
Itself be given You"-
But I, grown shrewder-scan the Skies
With a suspicious Air-
As Children-swindled for the first
All Swindlers-be-infer-
$I measure every Grief I meet (561)
I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing, Eyes--
I wonder if It weighs like Mine--
Or has an Easier size.
I wonder if They bore it long--
Or did it just begin--
I could not tell the Date of Mine--
It feels so old a pain--
I wonder if it hurts to live--
And if They have to try--
And whether--could They choose between--
It would not be--to die--
I note that Some--gone patient long--
At length, renew their smile--
An imitation of a Light
That has so little Oil--
I wonder if when Years have piled--
Some Thousands--on the Harm--
That hurt them early--such a lapse
Could give them any Balm--
Or would they go on aching still
Through Centuries of Nerve--
Enlightened to a larger Pain--
In Contrast with the Love--
The Grieved--are many--I am told--
There is the various Cause--
Death--is but one--and comes but once--
And only nails the eyes--
There's Grief of Want--and grief of Cold--
A sort they call "Despair"--
There's Banishment from native Eyes--
In Sight of Native Air--
And though I may not guess the kind--
Correctly--yet to me
A piercing Comfort it affords
In passing Calvary--
To note the fashions--of the Cross--
And how they're mostly worn--
Still fascinated to presume
That Some--are like My Own--
$I ment to find her when I came;
I meant to find her when I came;
Death had the same design;
But the success was his, it seems,
And the discomfit mine.
I meant to tell her how I longed
For just this single time;
But Death had told her so the first,
And she had hearkened him.
To wander now is my abode;
To rest,--to rest would be
A privilege of hurricane
To memory and me.
$I met a King this afternoon!
166
I met a King this afternoon!
He had not on a Crown indeed,
A little Palmleaf Hat was all,
And he was barefoot, I'm afraid!
But sure I am he Ermine wore
Beneath his faded Jacket's blue-
And sure I am, the crest he bore
Within that Jacket's pocket too!
For 'twas too stately for an Earl-
A Marquis would not go so grand!
'Twas possibly a Czar petite-
A Pope, or something of that kind!
If I must tell you, of a Horse
My freckled Monarch held the rein-
Doubtless an estimable Beast,
But not at all disposed to run!
And such a wagon! While I live
Dare I presume to see
Another such a vehicle
As then transported me!
Two other ragged Princes
His royal state partook!
Doubtless the first excursion
These sovereigns ever took!
I question if the Royal Coach
Round which the Footmen wait
Has the significance, on high,
Of this Barefoot Estate!
$I never felt at Home—Below
413
I never felt at Home—Below—-
And in the Handsome Skies
I shall not feel at Home—I know—
I don't like Paradise—
Because it's Sunday—all the time—
And Recess—never comes—
And Eden'll be so lonesome
Bright Wednesday Afternoons—
If God could make a visit—
Or ever took a Nap—
So not to see us—but they say
Himself—a Telescope
Perennial beholds us—
Myself would run away
From Him—and Holy Ghost—and All—
But there's the "Judgement Day"!
$I never hear the word 'escape'
I never hear the word 'escape'
Without a quicker blood,
A sudden expectation,
A flying attitude.
I never hear of prisons broad
By soldiers battered down,
But I tug childish at my bars, --
Only to fail again!
$I never lost as much but twice
49
I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod.
Twice have I stood a beggar
Before the door of God!
Angels-twice descending
Reimbursed my store-
Burglar! Banker-Father!
I am poor once more!
$I Never Saw a Moor
I never saw a moor;
I never saw the sea,
Yet know I how the heather looks
And what a billow be.
I never spoke with God,
Nor visited in heaven.
Yet certain am I of the spot
As if the checks were given.
$I never told the buried gold
11
I never told the buried gold
Upon the hill-that lies-
I saw the sun-his plunder done
Crouch low to guard his prize.
He stood as near
As stood you here-
A pace had been between-
Did but a snake bisect the brake
My life had forfeit been.
That was a wondrous booty-
I hope 'twas honest gained.
Those were the fairest ingots
That ever kissed the spade!
Whether to keep the secret-
Whether to reveal-
Whether as I ponder
Kidd will sudden sail-
Could a shrewd advise me
We might e'en divide-
Should a shrewd betray me-
Atropos decide!
$I often passed the village
51
I often passed the village
When going home from school-
And wondered what they did there-
And why it was so still-
I did not know the year then-
In which my call would come-
Earlier, by the Dial,
Than the rest have gone.
It's stiller than the sundown.
It's cooler than the dawn-
The Daisies dare to come here-
And birds can flutter down-
So when you are tired-
Or perplexed-or cold-
Trust the loving promise
Underneath the mould,
Cry "it's I," "take Dollie,"
And I will enfold!
$I pay—in Satin Cash

I pay—in Satin Cash—
You did not state—your price—
A Petal, for a Paragraph

$I play at Riches—to appease
801
I play at Riches—to appease
The Clamoring for Gold—
It kept me from a Thief, I think,
For often, overbold
With Want, and Opportunity—
I could have done a Sin
And been Myself that easy Thing
An independent Man—
But often as my lot displays
Too hungry to be borne
I deem Myself what I would be—
And novel Comforting
My Poverty and I derive—
We question if the Man—
Who own—Esteem the Opulence—
As We—Who never Can—
Should ever these exploring Hands
Chance Sovereign on a Mine—
Or in the long—uneven term
To win, become their turn—
How fitter they will be—for Want—
Enlightening so well—
I know not which, Desire, or Grant—
Be wholly beautiful—
$I prayed, at first, a little Girl
576
I prayed, at first, a little Girl,
Because they told me to-
But stopped, when qualified to guess
How prayer would feel-to me-
If I believed God looked around,
Each time my Childish eye
Fixed full, and steady, on his own
In Childish honesty-
And told him what I'd like, today,
And parts of his far plan
That baffled me-
The mingled side
Of his Divinity-
And often since, in Danger,
I count the force 'twould be
To have a God so strong as that
To hold my life for me
Till I could take the Balance
That tips so frequent, now,
It takes me all the while to poise-
And then-it doesn't stay-
$I read my sentence—steadily
412
I read my sentence—steadily—
Reviewed it with my eyes,
To see that I made no mistake
In its extremest clause—
The Date, and manner, of the shame—
And then the Pious Form
That "God have mercy" on the Soul
The Jury voted Him—
I made my soul familiar—with her extremity—
That at the last, it should not be a novel Agony—
But she, and Death, acquainted—
Meet tranquilly, as friends—
Salute, and pass, without a Hint—
And there, the Matter ends—
$I reason, Earth is short
301
I reason, Earth is short-
And Anguish-absolute-
And many hurt,
But, what of that?
I reason, we could die-
The best Vitality
Cannot excel Decay,
But, what of that?
I reason, that in Heaven-
Somehow, it will be even-
Some new Equation, given-
But, what of that?
$I reckon—when I count it all
569
I reckon—when I count it all—
First—Poets—Then the Sun—
Then Summer—Then the Heaven of God—
And then—the List is done—
But, looking back—the First so seems
To Comprehend the Whole—
The Others look a needless Show—
So I write—Poets—All—
Their Summer—lasts a Solid Year—
They can afford a Sun
The East—would deem extravagant—
And if the Further Heaven—
Be Beautiful as they prepare
For Those who worship Them—
It is too difficult a Grace—
To justify the Dream—
$I robbed the Woods
41
I robbed the Woods-
The trusting Woods.
The unsuspecting Trees
Brought out their Burs and mosses
My fantasy to please.
I scanned their trinkets curious-I grasped-I bore away-
What will the solemn Hemlock-
What will the Oak tree say?
$I rose—because He sank
616
I rose—because He sank—
I thought it would be opposite—
But when his power dropped—
My Soul grew straight.
I cheered my fainting Prince—
I sang firm—even—Chants—
I helped his Film—with Hymn—
And when the Dews drew off
That held his Forehead stiff—
I met him—
Balm to Balm—
I told him Best—must pass
Through this low Arch of Flesh—
No Casque so brave
It spurn the Grave—
I told him Worlds I knew
Where Emperors grew—
Who recollected us
If we were true—
And so with Thews of Hymn—
And Sinew from within—
And ways I knew not that I knew—till then—
I lifted Him—
$I saw no Way—The Heavens were stitched
378
I saw no Way—The Heavens were stitched—
I felt the Columns close—
The Earth reversed her Hemispheres—
I touched the Universe—
And back it slid—and I alone—
A Speck upon a Ball—
Went out upon Circumference—
Beyond the Dip of Bell—
$I see thee better—in the Dark
I see thee better—in the Dark—
I do not need a Light—
The Love of Thee—a Prism be—
Excelling Violet—
I see thee better for the Years
That hunch themselves between—
The Miner's Lamp—sufficient be—
To nullify the Mine—
And in the Grave—I see Thee best—
Its little Panels be
Aglow—All ruddy—with the Light
I held so high, for Thee—
What need of Day—
To Those whose Dark—hath so—surpassing Sun—
It deem it be—Continually—
At the Meridian?
$I send Two Sunsets
308
I send Two Sunsets-
Day and I-in competition ran-
I finished Two-and several Stars-
While He-was making One-
His own was ampler-but as I
Was saying to a friend-
Mine-is the more convenient
To Carry in the Hand-
$I shall keep singing!
250
I shall keep singing!
Birds will pass me
On their way to Yellower Climes-
Each-with a Robin's expectation-
I-with my Redbreast-
And my Rhymes-
Late-when I take my place in summer-
But-I shall bring a fuller tune-
Vespers-are sweeter than Matins-Signor-
Morning-only the seed of Noon-
$I shall know why—when Time is over
193
I shall know why—when Time is over—
And I have ceased to wonder why—
Christ will explain each separate anguish
In the fair schoolroom of the sky—
He will tell me what "Peter" promised—
And I—for wonder at his woe—
I shall forget the drop of Anguish
That scalds me now—that scalds me now!
$I should have been too glad, I see
313
I should have been too glad, I see-
Too lifted-for the scant degree
Of Life's penurious Round-
My little Circuit would have shamed
This new Circumference-have blamed-
The homelier time behind.
I should have been too saved-I see-
Too rescued-Fear too dim to me
That I could spell the Prayer
I knew so perfect-yesterday-
That Scalding One-Sabachthani-
Recited fluent-here-
Earth would have been too much-I see-
And Heaven-not enough for me-
I should have had the Joy
Without the Fear-to justify-
The Palm-without the Calvary-
So Savior-Crucify-
Defeat-whets Victory-they say-
The Reefs-in old Gethsemane-
Endear the Coast-beyond!
'Tis Beggars-Banquets-can define-
'Tis Parching-vitalizes Wine-
"Faith" bleats-to understand!
$I should not dare to leave my friend
205
I should not dare to leave my friend,
Because-because if he should die
While I was gone-and I-too late-
Should reach the Heart that wanted me-
If I should disappoint the eyes
That hunted-hunted so-to see-
And could not bear to shut until
They "noticed" me-they noticed me-
If I should stab the patient faith
So sure I'd come-so sure I'd come-
It listening-listening-went to sleep-
Telling my tardy name-
My Heart would wish it broke before-
Since breaking then-since breaking then-
Were useless as next morning's sun-
Where midnight frosts-had lain!
$I showed her Heights she never saw
446
I showed her Heights she never saw-
"Would'st Climb," I said?
She said-"Not so"-
"With me-" I said-With me?
I showed her Secrets-Morning's Nest-
The Rope the Nights were put across-
And now-"Would'st have me for a Guest?"
She could not find her Yes-
And then, I brake my life-And Lo,
A Light, for her, did solemn glow,
The larger, as her face withdrew-
And could she, further, "No"?
$I sing to use the Waiting
850
I sing to use the Waiting
My Bonnet but to tie
And shut the Door unto my House
No more to do have I
Till His best step approaching
We journey to the Day
And tell each other how We sung
To Keep the Dark away.
$I sometimes drop it, for a Quick
708
I sometimes drop it, for a Quick-
The Thought to be alive-
Anonymous Delight to know-
And Madder-to conceive-
Consoles a Woe so monstrous
That did it tear all Day,
Without an instant's Respite-
'Twould look too far-to Die-
$I started Early - Took my Dog
I started Early - Took my Dog -
And visited the Sea -
The Mermaids in the Basement
Came out to look at me -
And Frigates - in the Upper Floor
Extended Hempen Hands -
Presuming Me to be a Mouse -
Aground - upon the Sands -
But no Man moved Me - till the Tide
Went past my simple Shoe -
And past my Apron - and my Belt
And past my Bodice - too -
And made as He would eat me up -
As wholly as a Dew
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve -
And then - I started - too -
And He - He followed - close behind -
I felt His Silver Heel
Upon my Ankle - Then my Shoes
Would overflow with Pearl -
Until We met the Solid Town -
No One He seemed to know -
And bowing - with a Mighty look -
At me - The Sea withdrew -
$I stepped from plank to plank
I stepped from plank to plank
So slow and cautiously;
The stars about my head I felt,
About my feet the sea.
I knew not but the next
Would be my final inch,--
This gave me that precarious gait
Some call experience.
$I stole them from a Bee
200
I stole them from a Bee-
Because-Thee-
Sweet plea-
He pardoned me!
$I taste a liquor never brewed
I taste a liquor never brewed,
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol!
Inebriate of air am I,
And debauchee of dew,
Reeling, through endless summer days,
From inns of molten blue.
When the landlord turn the drunken bee
Out of the foxglove's door,
When butterflies renounce their drams,
I shall but drink the more!
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
And saints to windows run,
To see the little tippler
Leaning against the sun!
$I tend my flowers for thee
339
I tend my flowers for thee-
Bright Absentee!
My Fuchsia's Coral Seams
Rip-while the Sower-dreams-
Geraniums-tint-and spot-
Low Daisies-dot-
My Cactus-splits her Beard
To show her throat-
Carnations-tip their spice-
And Bees-pick up-
A Hyacinth-I hid-
Puts out a Ruffled Head-
And odors fall
From flasks-so small-
You marvel how they held-
Globe Roses-break their satin glake-
Upon my Garden floor-
Yet-thou-not there-
I had as lief they bore
No Crimson-more-
Thy flower-be gay-
Her Lord-away!
It ill becometh me-
I'll dwell in Calyx-Gray-
How modestly-alway-
Thy Daisy-
Draped for thee!
$I think I was enchanted
593
I think I was enchanted
When first a sombre Girl-
I read that Foreign Lady-
The Dark-felt beautiful-
And whether it was noon at night-
Or only Heaven-at Noon-
For very Lunacy of Light
I had not power to tell-
The Bees-became as Butterflies-
The Butterflies-as Swans-
Approached-and spurned the narrow Grass-
And just the meanest Tunes
That Nature murmured to herself
To keep herself in Cheer-
I took for Giants-practising
Titanic Opera-
The Days-to Mighty Metres stept-
The Homeliest-adorned
As if unto a Jubilee
'Twere suddenly confirmed-
I could not have defined the change-
Conversion of the Mind
Like Sanctifying in the Soul-
Is witnessed-not explained-
'Twas a Divine Insanity-
The Danger to be Sane
Should I again experience-
'Tis Antidote to turn-
To Tomes of solid Witchcraft-
Magicians be asleep-
But Magic-hath an Element
Like Deity-to keep-
$I think just how my shape will rise
237
I think just how my shape will rise-
When I shall be "forgiven"-
Till Hair-and Eyes-and timid Head-
Are out of sight-in Heaven-
I think just how my lips will weigh-
With shapeless-quivering-prayer-
That you-so late-"Consider" me-
The "Sparrow" of your Care-
I mind me that of Anguish-sent-
Some drifts were moved away-
Before my simple bosom-broke-
And why not this-if they?
And so I con that thing-"forgiven"-
Until-delirious-borne-
By my long bright-and longer-trust-
I drop my Heart-unshriven!
$I think the Hemlock likes to stand
525
I think the Hemlock likes to stand
Upon a Marge of Snow-
It suits his own Austerity-
And satisfies an awe
That men, must slake in Wilderness-
And in the Desert-cloy-
An instinct for the Hoar, the Bald-
Lapland's-necessity-
The Hemlock's nature thrives-on cold-
The Gnash of Northern winds
Is sweetest nutriment-to him-
His best Norwegian Wines-
To satin Races-he is nought-
But Children on the Don,
Beneath his Tabernacles, play,
And Dnieper Wrestlers, run.
$I think the longest Hour of all
635
I think the longest Hour of all
Is when the Cars have come-
And we are waiting for the Coach-
It seems as though the Time
Indignant-that the Joy was come-
Did block the Gilded Hands-
And would not let the Seconds by-
But slowest instant-ends-
The Pendulum begins to count-
Like little Scholars-loud-
The steps grow thicker-in the Hall-
The Heart begins to crowd-
Then I-my timid service done-
Tho' service 'twas, of Love-
Take up my little Violin-
And further North-remove.
$I think to Live—may be a Bliss
646
I think to Live—may be a Bliss
To those who dare to try—
Beyond my limit to conceive—
My lip—to testify—
I think the Heart I former wore
Could widen—till to me
The Other, like the little Bank
Appear—unto the Sea—
I think the Days—could every one
In Ordination stand—
And Majesty—be easier—
Than an inferior kind—
No
No

But Certainties of Sun—

The Vision—pondered long—
So plausible becomes
That I esteem the fiction—real—

As the very least
Were infinite—to me—
I put new Blossoms in the Glass—
And throw the old—away—
I push a petal from my gown
That anchored there—I weigh
The time 'twill be till six o'clock
I have so much to do—
And yet—Existence—some way back—
Stopped—struck—my tickling—through—
We cannot put Ourself away
As a completed Man
Or Woman—When the Errand's done
We came to Flesh—upon—
There may be—Miles on Miles of Nought—
Of Action—sicker far—
To simulate—is stinging work—
To cover what we are
From Science—and from Surgery—
Too Telescopic Eyes
To bear on us unshaded—
For their—sake—not for Ours—
'Twould start them—
We—could tremble—
But since we got a Bomb—
And held it in our Bosom—
Nay—Hold it—it is calm—
Therefore—we do life's labor—
Though life's Reward—be done—
With scrupulous exactness—
To hold our Senses—on—
$I took my Power in my Hand
540
I took my Power in my Hand-
And went against the World-
'Twas not so much as David-had-
But I-was twice as bold-
I aimed by Pebble-but Myself
Was all the one that fell-
Was it Goliath-was too large-
Or was myself-too small?
$I tried to think a lonelier Thing
532
I tried to think a lonelier Thing
Than any I had seen-
Some Polar Expiation-An Omen in the Bone
Of Death's tremendous nearness-
I probed Retrieverless things
My Duplicate-to borrow-
A Haggard Comfort springs
From the belief that Somewhere-
Within the Clutch of Thought-
There dwells one other Creature
Of Heavenly Love-forgot-
I plucked at our Partition
As One should pry the Walls-
Between Himself-and Horror's Twin-
Within Opposing Cells-
I almost strove to clasp his Hand,
Such Luxury-it grew-
That as Myself-could pity Him-
Perhaps he-pitied me-
$I want—it pleaded—All its life—
"I want"—it pleaded—All its life—
I want—was chief it said
When Skill entreated it—the last—
And when so newly dead—
I could not deem it late—to hear
That single—steadfast sigh—
The lips had placed as with a "Please"
Toward Eternity—
$I was the slightest in the House
486
I was the slightest in the House-
I took the smallest Room-
At night, my little Lamp, and Book-
And one Geranium-
So stationed I could catch the Mint
That never ceased to fall-
And just my Basket-
Let me think-I'm sure-
That this was all-
I never spoke-unless addressed-
And then, 'twas brief and low-
I could not bear to live-aloud-
The Racket shamed me so-
And if it had not been so far-
And any one I knew
Were going-I had often thought
How noteless-I could die-
$I watched the Moon around the House (629)
I watched the Moon around the House
Until upon a Pane --
She stopped -- a Traveller's privilege -- for Rest --
And there upon
I gazed -- as at a stranger --
The Lady in the Town
Doth think no incivility
To lift her Glass -- upon --
But never Stranger justified
The Curiosity
Like Mine -- for not a Foot -- nor Hand --
Nor Formula -- had she --
But like a Head -- a Guillotine
Slid carelessly away --
Did independent, Amber --
Sustain her in the sky --
Or like a Stemless Flower --
Upheld in rolling Air
By finer Gravitations --
Than bind Philosopher --
No Hunger -- had she -- nor an Inn --
Her Toilette -- to suffice --
Nor Avocation nor Concern
for little Mysteries
As harass us -- like Life -- and Death --
And Afterwards -- or Nay --
But seemed engrossed to Absolute --
With shining -- and the Sky --
The privilege to scrutinize
Was scarce upon my Eyes
When, with a Silver practise --
She vaulted out of Gaze --
And next -- I met her on a Cloud --
Myself too far below
To follow her superior Road --
Or its advantage -- Blue --
$I went to heaven,--
I went to heaven,--
'T was a small town,
Lit with a ruby,
Lathed with down.
Stiller than the fields
At the full dew,
Beautiful as pictures
No man drew.
People like the moth,
Of mechlin, frames,
Duties of gossamer,
And eider names.
Almost contented
I could be
'Mong such unique
Society.

363
I went to thank Her-
But She Slept-
Her Bed-a funneled Stone-
With Nosegays at the Head and Foot-
That Travellers-had thrown-
Who went to thank Her-
But She Slept-
'Twas Short-to cross the Sea-
To look upon Her like-alive-
But turning back-'twas slow-

I would distil a cup,
And bear to all my friends,
Drinking to her no more astir,
By beck, or burn, or moor!
$I would not paint—a picture
505
I would not paint—a picture—
I'd rather be the One
Its bright impossibility
To dwell—delicious—on—
And wonder how the fingers feel
Whose rare—celestial—stir—
Evokes so sweet a Torment—
Such sumptuous—Despair—
I would not talk, like Cornets—
I'd rather be the One
Raised softly to the Ceilings—
And out, and easy on—
Through Villages of Ether—
Myself endued Balloon
By but a lip of Metal—
The pier to my Pontoon—
Nor would I be a Poet—
It's finer—own the Ear—
Enamored—impotent—content—
The License to revere,
A privilege so awful
What would the Dower be,
Had I the Art to stun myself
With Bolts of Melody!
$I years had been from home,
I years had been from home,
And now, before the door,
I dared not open, lest a face
I never saw before
Stare vacant into mine
And ask my business there.
My business,--just a life I left,
Was such still dwelling there?
I fumbled at my nerve,
I scanned the windows near;
The silence like an ocean rolled,
And broke against my ear.
I laughed a wooden laugh
That I could fear a door,
Who danger and the dead had faced,
But never quaked before.
I fitted to the latch
My hand, with trembling care,
Lest back the awful door should spring,
And leave me standing there.
I moved my fingers off
As cautiously as glass,
And held my ears, and like a thief
Fled gasping from the house.
$I’ll tell you how the sun rose
I’ll tell you how the sun rose, -
A ribbon at a time.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
The news like squirrels ran.
The hills untied their bonnets,
The bobolinks begun.
Then I said softly to myself,
"That must have been the sun!"
But how he set, I know not.
There seemed a purple stile.
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while
Till when they reached the other side,
A dominie in gray
Put gently up the evening bars,
And led the flock away.

358
If any sink, assure that this, now standing-
Failed like Themselves-and conscious that it rose-
Grew by the Fact, and not the Understanding
How Weakness passed-or Force-arose-
Tell that the Worst, is easy in a Moment-
Dread, but the Whizzing, before the Ball-
When the Ball enters, enters Silence-
Dying-annuls the power to kill.
$If anybody's friend be dead
509
If anybody's friend be dead
It's sharpest of the theme
The thinking how they walked alive-
At such and such a time-
Their costume, of a Sunday,
Some manner of the Hair-
A prank nobody knew but them
Lost, in the Sepulchre-
How warm, they were, on such a day,
You almost feel the date-
So short way off it seems-
And now-they're Centuries from that-
How pleased they were, at what you said-
You try to touch the smile
And dip your fingers in the frost-
When was it-Can you tell-
You asked the Company to tea-
Acquaintance-just a few-
And chatted close with this Grand Thing
That don't remember you-
Past Bows, and Invitations-
Past Interview, and Vow-
Past what Ourself can estimate-
That-makes the Quick of Woe!
$If Blame be my side—forfeit Me
775
If Blame be my side—forfeit Me—
But doom me not to forfeit Thee—
To forfeit Thee? The very name
Is sentence from Belief—and House—
$If He dissolve—then—there is nothing
236
If He dissolve—then—there is nothing—more—
Eclipse—at Midnight—
It was dark—before—
Sunset—at Easter—
Blindness—on the Dawn—
Faint Star of Bethlehem—
Gone down!
Would but some God—inform Him—
Or it be too late!
Say—that the pulse just lisps—
The Chariots wait—
Say—that a little life—for His—
Is leaking—red—
His little Spaniel—tell Him!
Will He heed?
$If He were living—dare I ask
734
If He were living—dare I ask—
And how if He be dead—
And so around the Words I went—
Of meeting them—afraid—
I hinted Changes—Lapse of Time—
The Surfaces of Years—
I touched with Caution—lest they crack—
And show me to my fears—
Reverted to adjoining Lives—
Adroitly turning out
Wherever I suspected Graves—
'Twas prudenter—I thought—
And He—I pushed—with sudden force—
In face of the Suspense—
"Was buried"—"Buried"! "He!"
My Life just holds the Trench—
$If I can stop one heart from breaking,
If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain.
$If I could bribe them by a Rose
179
If I could bribe them by a Rose
I'd bring them every flower that grows
From Amherst to Cashmere!
I would not stop for night, or storm-
Or frost, or death, or anyone-
My business were so dear!
If they would linger for a Bird
My Tambourin were soonest heard
Among the April Woods!
Unwearied, all the summer long,
Only to break in wilder song
When Winter shook the boughs!
What if they hear me!
Who shall say
That such an importunity
May not at last avail?
That, weary of this Beggar's face-
They may not finally say, Yes-
To drive her from the Hall?
$If I may have it, when it's dead
577
If I may have it, when it's dead,
I'll be contented-so-
If just as soon as Breath is out
It shall belong to me-
Until they lock it in the Grave,
'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh-
For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,
Myself-can own the key-
Think of it Lover! I and Thee
Permitted-face to face to be-
After a Life-a Death-We'll say-
For Death was That-
And this-is Thee-
I'll tell Thee All-how Bald it grew-
How Midnight felt, at first-to me-
How all the Clocks stopped in the World-
And Sunshine pinched me-'Twas so cold-
Then how the Grief got sleepy-some-
As if my Soul were deaf and dumb-
Just making signs-across-to Thee-
That this way-thou could'st notice me-
I'll tell you how I tried to keep
A smile, to show you, when this Deep
All Waded-We look back for Play,
At those Old Times-in Calvary,
Forgive me, if the Grave come slow-
For Coveting to look at Thee-
Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost
Outvisions Paradise!
$If I should cease to bring a Rose
56
If I should cease to bring a Rose
Upon a festal day,
'Twill be because beyond the Rose
I have been called away-
If I should cease to take the names
My buds commemorate-
'Twill be because Death's finger
Claps my murmuring lip!
$If I should die
54
If I should die,
And you should live-
And time should gurgle on-
And morn should beam-
And noon should burn-
As it has usual done-
If Birds should build as early
And Bees as bustling go-
One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with Daisies lie-
That Commerce will continue-
And Trades as briskly fly-
It makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene-
That gentlemen so sprightly
Conduct the pleasing scene!
$If I shouldn't be alive
182
If I shouldn't be alive
When the Robins come,
Give the one in Red Cravat,
A Memorial crumb.
If I couldn't thank you,
Being fast asleep,
You will know I'm trying
Why my Granite lip!
$If I'm lost-now
256
If I'm lost-now
That I was found-
Shall still my transport be-
That once-on me-those Jasper Gates
Blazed open-suddenly-
That in my awkward-gazing-face-
The Angels-softly peered-
And touched me with their fleeces,
Almost as if they cared-
I'm banished-now-you know it-
How foreign that can be-
You'll know-Sir-when the Savior's face
Turns so-away from you-
$If it had no pencil
921
If it had no pencil
Would it try mine-
Worn-now-and dull-sweet,
Writing much to thee.
If it had no word,
Would it make the Daisy,
Most as big as I was,
When it plucked me?
$If pain for peace prepares
63
If pain for peace prepares
Lo, what "Augustan" years
Our feet await!
If springs from winter rise,
Can the Anemones
Be reckoned up?
If night stands fast-then noon
To gird us for the sun,
What gaze!
When from a thousand skies
On our developed eyes
Noons blaze!
$If recollecting were forgetting
33
If recollecting were forgetting,
Then I remember not.
And if forgetting, recollecting,
How near I had forgot.
And if to miss, were merry,
And to mourn, were gay,
How very blithe the fingers
That gathered this, Today!
$If she had been the Mistletoe
44
If she had been the Mistletoe
And I had been the Rose-
How gay upon your table
My velvet life to close-
Since I am of the Druid,
And she is of the dew-
I'll deck Tradition's buttonhole-
And send the Rose to you.
$If the foolish, call them "flowers"
168
If the foolish, call them "flowers"-
Need the wiser, tell?
If the Savants "Classify" them
It is just as well!
Those who read the "Revelations"
Must not criticize
Those who read the same Edition-
With beclouded Eyes!
Could we stand with that Old "Moses"-
"Canaan" denied-
Scan like him, the stately landscape
On the other side-
Doubtless, we should deem superfluous
Many Sciences,
Not pursued by learned Angels
In scholastic skies!
Low amid that glad Belles lettres
Grant that we may stand,
Stars, amid profound Galaxies-
At that grand "Right hand"!
$If this is "fading"
120
If this is "fading"
Oh let me immediately "fade"!
If this is "dying"
Bury me, in such a shroud of red!
If this is "sleep,"
On such a night
How proud to shut the eye!
Good Evening, gentle Fellow men!
Peacock presumes to die!
$If those I loved were lost
29
If those I loved were lost
The Crier's voice would tell me-
If those I loved were found
The bells of Ghent would ring-
Did those I loved repose
The Daisy would impel me.
Philip-when bewildered
Bore his riddle in!
$If What we could-were what we would
407
If What we could-were what we would-
Criterion-be small-
It is the Ultimate of Talk-
The Impotence to Tell-
$If you were coming in the fall,
If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by
With half a smile and half a spum,
As housewives do a fly.
If I could see you in a year,
I'd wind the months in balls,
And put them each in separate drawers,
Until their time befalls.
If only centuries delayed,
I'd count them on my hand,
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.
If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
And taste eternity.
But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.
$If your Nerve, deny you
292
If your Nerve, deny you-
Go above your Nerve-
He can lean against the Grave,
If he fear to swerve-
That's a steady posture-
Never any bend
Held of those Brass arms-
Best Giant made-
If your Soul seesaw-
Lift the Flesh door-
The Poltroon wants Oxygen-
Nothing more-
$I'll clutch—and clutch
427
I'll clutch—and clutch—
Next—One—Might be the golden touch—
Could take it—
Diamonds—Wait—
I'm diving—just a little late—
But stars—go slow—for night—
I'll string you—in fine Necklace—
Tiaras—make—of some—
Wear you on Hem—
Loop up a Countess—with you—
Make—a Diadem—and mend my old One—
Count—Hoard—then lose—
And doubt that you are mine—
To have the joy of feeling it—again—
I'll show you at the Court—
Bear you—for Ornament
Where Women breathe—
That every sigh—may lift you
Just as high—as I—
And—when I die—
In meek array—display you—
Still to show—how rich I go—
Lest Skies impeach a wealth so wonderful—
And banish me—
$I'll send the feather from my Hat!
687
I'll send the feather from my Hat!
Who knows-but at the sight of that
My Sovereign will relent?
As trinket-worn by faded Child-
Confronting eyes long-comforted-
Blisters the Adamant!

That other state—
I'm Czar—I'm "Woman" now—
It's safer so—
How odd the Girl's life looks
Behind this soft Eclipse—
I think that Earth feels so
To folks in Heaven—now—
This being comfort—then
That other kind—was pain—
But why compare?
I'm "Wife"! Stop there!

508
I'm ceded—I've stopped being Theirs—
The name They dropped upon my face
With water, in the country church
Is finished using, now,
And They can put it with my Dolls,
My childhood, and the string of spools,
I've finished threading—too—
Baptized, before, without the choice,
But this time, consciously, of Grace—
Unto supremest name—
Called to my Full—The Crescent dropped—
Existence's whole Arc, filled up,
With one small Diadem.
My second Rank—too small the first—
Crowned—Crowing—on my Father's breast—
A half unconscious Queen—
But this time—Adequate—Erect,
With Will to choose, or to reject,
And I choose, just a Crown—
$I'm nobody! Who are you?
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us -- don't tell!

How dreary to be somebody!
How public like a frog
To tell one's name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
$I'm saying every day

I'm saying every day
"If I should be a Queen, tomorrow"-
I'd do this way-
And so I deck, a little,
If it be, I wake a Bourbon,
None on me, bend supercilious-
With "This was she-
Begged in the Market place-
Yesterday."
Court is a stately place-
I've heard men say-
So I loop my apron, against the Majesty
With bright Pins of Buttercup-
That not too plain-
Rank-overtake me-
And perch my Tongue
On Twigs of singing-rather high-
But this, might be my brief Term
To qualify-
Put from my simple speech all plain word-
Take other accents, as such I heard
Though but for the Cricket-just,
And but for the Bee-
Not in all the Meadow-
One accost me-
Better to be ready-
Than did next morn
Meet me in Aragon-
My old Gown-on-
And the surprised Air
Rustics-wear-
Summoned-unexpectedly-
To Exeter-
$I'm sorry for the Dead—Today
529
I'm sorry for the Dead—Today—
It's such congenial times
Old Neighbors have at fences—
It's time o' year for Hay.
And Broad—Sunburned Acquaintance
Discourse between the Toil—
And laugh, a homely species
That makes the Fences smile—
It seems so straight to lie away
From all of the noise of Fields—
The Busy Carts—the fragrant Cocks—
The Mower's Metre—Steals—
A Trouble lest they're homesick—
Those Farmers—and their Wives—
Set separate from the Farming—
And all the Neighbors' lives—
A Wonder if the Sepulchre
Don't feel a lonesome way—
When Men—and Boys—and Carts—and June,
Go down the Fields to "Hay"—

I, must resoluter be!
Who'll apologize for me?
Dear, Old fashioned, little flower!

Birds are antiquated fellows!
Heaven does not change her blue.
Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease—
Ever be induced to do!

Impossibility, like Wine
Exhilarates the Man

A Chance's faintest Tincture
And in the former Dram

As certainly as Doom-
$In Ebon Box, when years have flown
169
In Ebon Box, when years have flown
To reverently peer,
Wiping away the velvet dust
Summers have sprinkled there!
To hold a letter to the light-
Grown Tawny now, with time-
To con the faded syllables
That quickened us like Wine!
Perhaps a Flower's shrivelled check
Among its stores to find-
Plucked far away, some morning-
By gallant-mouldering hand!
A curl, perhaps, from foreheads
Our Constancy forgot-
Perhaps, an Antique trinket-
In vanished fashions set!
And then to lay them quiet back-
And go about its care-
As if the little Ebon Box
Were none of our affair!

In falling Timbers buried-
There breathed a Man-
Outside-the spades-were plying-
The Lungs-within-
Could He-know-they sought Him-
Could They-know-He breathed-
Horrid Sand Partition-
Neither-could be heard-
Never slacked the Diggers-
But when Spades had done-
Oh, Reward of Anguish,
It was dying-Then-
Many Things-are fruitless-
'Tis a Baffling Earth-
But there is no Gratitude
Like the Grace-of Death-
$In lands I never saw—they say

In lands I never saw—they say
Immortal Alps look down—
Whose Bonnets touch the firmament—
Whose Sandals touch the town—
Meek at whose everlasting feet
A Myriad Daisy play—
Which, Sir, are you and which am I
Upon an August day?
$In rags mysterious as these

In rags mysterious as these
The shining Courtiers go-
Veiling the purple, and the plumes-
Veiling the ermine so.
Smiling, as they request an alms-
At some imposing door!
Smiling when we walk barefoot
Upon their golden floor!
$In Winter in my Room
1670
In Winter in my Room
I came upon a Worm-
Pink, lank and warm-
But as he was a worm
And worms presume
Not quite with him at home-
Secured him by a string
To something neighboring
And went along.
A Trifle afterward
A thing occurred
I'd not believe it if I heard
But state with creeping blood-
A snake with mottles rare
Surveyed my chamber floor
In feature as the worm before
But ringed with power-
The very string with which
I tied him-too
When he was mean and new
That string was there-
I shrank-"How fair you are"!
Propitiation's claw-
"Afraid," he hissed
"Of me"?
"No cordiality"-
He fathomed me-
Then to a Rhythm Slim
Secreted in his Form
As Patterns swim
Projected him.
That time I flew
Both eyes his way
Lest he pursue
Nor ever ceased to run
Till in a distant Town
Towns on from mine
I set me down
This was a dream.
$Inconceivably solemn!
582
Inconceivably solemn!
Things go gay
Pierce-by the very Press
Of Imagery-
Their far Parades-order on the eye
With a mute Pomp-
A pleading Pageantry-
Flags, are a brave sight-
But no true Eye
Ever went by One-
Steadily-
Music's triumphant-
But the fine Ear
Winces with delight
Are Drums too near-
$Is Bliss then, such Abyss
340
Is Bliss then, such Abyss,
I must not put my foot amiss
For fear I spoil my shoe?
I'd rather suit my foot
Than save my Boot-
For yet to buy another Pair
Is possible,
At any store-
But Bliss, is sold just once.
The Patent lost
None buy it any more-
Say, Foot, decide the point-
The Lady cross, or not?
Verdict for Boot!
$Is it dead—Find it

"Homesick"? Many met it—
Even through them—This
Cannot testify—
Themself—as dumb—

For fear of joggling Him!

In a Coffee Cup,
Or tie him to a pin
Till I got in-
Or make him fast
To "Toby's" fist-
Hist! Whist! I'd come!
$It always felt to me—a wrong
597
It always felt to me—a wrong
To that Old Moses—done—
To let him see—the Canaan—
Without the entering—
And tho' in soberer moments—
No Moses there can be
I'm satisfied—the Romance
In point of injury—
Surpasses sharper stated—
Of Stephen—or of Paul—
For these—were only put to death—
While God's adroiter will
On Moses—seemed to fasten
With tantalizing Play
As Boy—should deal with lesser Boy—
To prove ability.
The fault—was doubtless Israel's—
Myself—had banned the Tribes—
And ushered Grand Old Moses
In Pentateuchal Robes
Upon the Broad Possession
'Twas little—But titled Him—to see—
Old Man on Nebo! Late as this—
My justice bleeds—for Thee!
$It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon
978
It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon-
The Flower-distinct and Red-
I, passing, thought another Noon
Another in its stead
Will equal glow, and thought no More
But came another Day
To find the Species disappeared-
The Same Locality-
The Sun in place-no other fraud
On Nature's perfect Sum-
Had I but lingered Yesterday-
Was my retrieveless blame-
Much Flowers of this and further Zones
Have perished in my Hands
For seeking its Resemblance-
But unapproached it stands-
The single Flower of the Earth
That I, in passing by
Unconscious was-Great Nature's Face
Passed infinite by Me-
$It can't be "Summer"!

There's that long town of White-to cross-
Before the Blackbirds sing!

So Sunset shuts my question down
With Cuffs of Chrysolite!
$It ceased to hurt me, though so slow
584
It ceased to hurt me, though so slow
I could not feel the Anguish go-
But only knew by looking back-
That something-had benumbed the Track-
Nor when it altered, I could say,
For I had worn it, every day,
As constant as the Childish frock-
I hung upon the Peg, at night.
But not the Grief-that nestled close
As needles-ladies softly press
To Cushions Cheeks-
To keep their place-
Nor what consoled it, I could trace-
Except, whereas 'twas Wilderness-
It's better-almost Peace-
$It did not surprise me
39
It did not surprise me-
So I said-or thought-
She will stir her pinions
And the nest forgot,
Traverse broader forests-
Build in gayer boughs,
Breathe in Ear more modern
God's old fashioned vows-
This was but a Birdling-
What and if it be
One within my bosom
Had departed me?
This was but a story-
What and if indeed
There were just such coffin
In the heart instead?
$It don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did

It don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did—
I run it over—"Dead", Brain, "Dead."
Put it in Latin—left of my school—
Seems it don't shriek so—under rule.
Turn it, a little—full in the face
A Trouble looks bitterest—
Shift it—just—
Say "When Tomorrow comes this way—
I shall have waded down one Day."
I suppose it will interrupt me some
Till I get accustomed—but then the Tomb
Like other new Things—shows largest—then—
And smaller, by Habit—
It's shrewder then
Put the Thought in advance—a Year—
How like "a fit"—then—
Murder—wear!

$It feels a shame to be Alive

It feels a shame to be Alive-
When Men so brave-are dead-
One envies the Distinguished Dust-
Permitted-such a Head-
The Stone-that tells defending Whom
This Spartan put away
What little of Him we-possessed
In Pawn for Liberty-
The price is great-Sublimely paid-
Do we deserve-a Thing-
That lives-like Dollars-must be piled
Before we may obtain?
Are we that wait-sufficient worth-
That such Enormous Pearl
As life-dissolved be-for Us-
In Battle's-horrid Bowl?
It may be-a Renown to live-
I think the Man who die-
Those unsustained-Saviors-
Present Divinity-
$It is a lonesome Glee
774
It is a lonesome Glee-
Yet sanctifies the Mind-
With fair association-
Afar upon the Wind
A Bird to overhear
Delight without a Cause-
Arrestless as invisible-
A matter of the Skies.

It is an honorable thought,
And makes one lift one's hat,

Though pyramids decay,
And kingdoms, like the orchard,
Flit russetly away.
$It is easy to work when the soul is at play

It is easy to work when the soul is at play-
But when the soul is in pain-
The hearing him put his playthings up
Makes work difficult-then-
It is simple, to ache in the Bone, or the Rind-
But Gimlets-among the nerve-
Mangle daintier-terribler-
Like a Panter in the Glove-

Burned on-until through Dissolution-
It failed from Men-
I could not deem these Planetary forces

But suffered an Exchange of Territory-
Or World-

It knew no Medicine-
It was not Sickness-then-
Nor any need of Surgery-
And therefore-'twas not Pain-
It moved away the Cheeks-
A Dimple at a time-
And left the Profile-plainer-
And in the place of Bloom
It left the little Tint
That never had a Name-
You've seen it on a Cast's face-
Was Paradise-to blame-
If momently ajar-
Temerity-drew near-
And sickened-ever afterward
For Somewhat that it saw?

And split their Pods of Flame-
Wild flowers-kindle in the Woods-

For passing Calvary-
Auto da Fe-and Judgment-
Are nothing to the Bee-
His separation from His Rose-
To Him-sums Misery-

Perhaps the Other-Peace-
Would interrupt the Dark-
And crowd the little Room-
Too scant-by Cubits-to contain
The Sacrament-of Him-
I am not used to Hope-
It might intrude upon-
Its sweet parade-blaspheme the place-
Ordained to Suffering-
It might be easier
To fail-with Land in Sight-
Than gain-My Blue Peninsula-
To perish-of Delight-

It sifts from Leaden Sieves-
It powders all the Wood.
It fills with Alabaster Wool
The Wrinkles of the Road-
It makes an Even Face
Of Mountain, and of Plain-
Unbroken Forehead from the East
Unto the East again-
It reaches to the Fence-
It wraps it Rail by Rail
Till it is lost in Fleeces-
It deals Celestial Vail
To Stump, and Stack-and Stem-
A Summer's empty Room-
Acres of Joints, where Harvests were,
Recordless, but for them--
It Ruffles Wrists of Posts
As Ankles of a Queen-
Then stills its Artisans-like Ghosts-
Denying they have been-
$It struck me every day
It struck me every day
The lightning was as new
As if the cloud that instant slit
And let the fire through.
It burned me in the night,
It blistered in my dream;
It sickened fresh upon my sight
With every morning's beam.
I thought that storm was brief,--
The maddest, quickest by;
But Nature lost the date of this,
And left it in the sky.

And groped delirious, for Morn—
It slipped—and slipped—
As One that drunken—stept—
Its white foot tripped—
Then dropped from sight—
Ah, Brig—Good Night
To Crew and You—
The Ocean's Heart too smooth—too Blue—
To break for You—
$It troubled me as once I was
600
It troubled me as once I was-
For I was once a Child-
Concluding how an Atom-fell-
And yet the Heavens-held-
The Heavens weighed the most-by far-
Yet Blue-and solid-stood-
Without a Bolt-that I could prove-
Would Giants-understand?
Life set me larger-problems-
Some I shall keep-to solve
Till Algebra is easier-
Or simpler proved-above-
Then-too-be comprehended-
What sorer-puzzled me-
Why Heaven did not break away-
And tumble-Blue-on me-
$It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone
876
It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone
Enclosed 'twas not of Rail
A Consciousness its Acre, and
It held a Human Soul.
Entombed by whom, for what offence
If Home or Foreign born-
Had I the curiosity
'Twere not appeased of men
Till Resurrection, I must guess
Denied the small desire
A Rose upon its Ridge to sow
Or take away a Briar.
$It was given to me by the Gods
454
It was given to me by the Gods-
When I was a little Girl-
They given us Presents most-you know-
When we are new-and small.
I kept it in my Hand-
I never put it down-
I did not dare to eat-or sleep-
For fear it would be gone-
I heard such words as "Rich"-
When hurrying to school-
From lips at Corners of the Streets-
And wrestled with a smile.
Rich! 'Twas Myself-was rich-
To take the name of Gold-
And Gold to own-in solid Bars-
The Difference-made me bold-
$It was not death, for I stood up,
It was not death, for I stood up,
And all the dead lie down;
It was not night, for all the bells
Put out their tongues, for noon.
It was not frost, for on my flesh
I felt siroccos crawl,--
Nor fire, for just my marble feet
Could keep a chancel cool.
And yet it tasted like them all;
The figures I have seen
Set orderly, for burial,
Reminded me of mine,
As if my life were shaven
And fitted to a frame,
And could not breathe without a key;
And 't was like midnight, some,
When everything that ticked has stopped,
And space stares, all around,
Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,
Repeal the beating ground.
But most like chaos,--stopless, cool,--
Without a chance or spar,--
Or even a report of land
To justify despair.
$It was too late for Man
623
It was too late for Man-
But early, yet, for God-
Creation-impotent to help-
But Prayer-remained-Our Side-
How excellent the Heaven-
When Earth-cannot be had-
How hospitable-then-the face
Of our Old Neighbor-God-
$It will be Summer—eventually
342
It will be Summer—eventually.
Ladies—with parasols—
Sauntering Gentlemen—with Canes—
And little Girls—with Dolls—
Will tint the pallid landscape—
As 'twere a bright Bouquet—
Thro' drifted deep, in Parian—
The Village lies—today—
The Lilacs—bending many a year—
Will sway with purple load—
The Bees—will not despise the tune—
Their Forefathers—have hummed—
The Wild Rose—redden in the Bog—
The Aster—on the Hill
Her everlasting fashion—set—
And Covenant Gentians—frill—
Till Summer folds her miracle—
As Women—do—their Gown—
Of Priests—adjust the Symbols—
When Sacrament—is done—
$It would have starved a Gnat
612
It would have starved a Gnat-
To live so small as I-
And yet I was a living Child-
With Food's necessity
Upon me-like a Claw-
I could no more remove
Than I could coax a Leech away-
Or make a Dragon-move-
Not like the Gnat-had I-
The privilege to fly
And seek a Dinner for myself-
How mightier He-than I-
Nor like Himself-the Art
Upon the Window Pane
To gad my little Being out-
And not begin-again-
$It would never be Common—more—I said

Such bliss—had I—for all the years—
'Twould give an Easier—pain—
I'd so much joy—I told it—Red—
Upon my simple Cheek—
I felt it publish—in my Eye—
'Twas needless—any speak—
I walked—as wings—my body bore—
The feet—I former used—
Unnecessary—now to me—
As boots—would be—to Birds—
I put my pleasure all abroad—
I dealth a word of Gold
To every Creature—that I met—
And Dowered—all the World—
When—suddenly—my Riches shrank—
A Goblin—drank my Dew—
My Palaces—dropped tenantless—
Myself—was beggared—too—
I clutched at sounds—
I groped at shapes—
I touched the tops of Films—
I felt the Wilderness roll back
Along my Golden lines—
The Sackcloth—hangs upon the nail—
The Frock I used to wear—
But where my moment of Brocade—
My—drop—of India?
$It's all I have to bring today

This, and my heart, and all the Bees
Which in the Clover dwell.

It gains the Block—and now—it gains the Door—
Chooses its latch, from all the other fastenings—

Bold—were it Enemy—Brief—were it friend—
Dresses each House in Crape, and Icicle—
And carries one—out of it—to God—
$It's easy to invent a Life
724
It's easy to invent a Life-
God does it-every Day-
Creation-but the Gambol
Of His Authority-
It's easy to efface it-
The thrifty Deity
Could scarce afford Eternity
To Spontaneity-
The Perished Patterns murmur-
But His Perturbless Plan
Proceed-inserting Here-a Sun-
There-leaving out a Man-
$It's like the light, --
It's like the light, --
A fashionless delight
It's like the bee, --
A dateless melody.
It's like the woods,
Private like breeze,
Phraseless, yet it stirs
The proudest trees.
It's like the morning, --
Best when it's done, --
The everlasting clocks
Chime noon.

For needing more—

Though Winter fire—sing clear as Plover—
To our—ear—
A Landscape—not so great
To suffocate the Eye—

Perhaps—the profile of a Mill
Turned by the Wind—

It's thoughts—and just two Heart—
And Heaven—about—
At least—a Counterfeit—

$I've heard an Organ talk, sometimes
183
I've heard an Organ talk, sometimes
In a Cathedral Aisle,
And understood no word it said-
Yet held my breath, the while-
And risen up-and gone away,
A more Berdardine Girl-
Yet-know not what was done to me
In that old Chapel Aisle.
$I've known a Heaven, like a Tent
243
I've known a Heaven, like a Tent-
To wrap its shining Yards-
Pluck up its stakes, and disappear-
Without the sound of Boards
Or Rip of Nail-Or Carpenter-
But just the miles of Stare-
That signalize a Show's Retreat-
In North America-
No Trace-no Figment of the Thing
That dazzled, Yesterday,
No Ring-no Marvel-
Men, and Feats-
Dissolved as utterly-
As Bird's far Navigation
Discloses just a Hue-
A plash of Oars, a Gaiety-
Then swallowed up, of View.
$I've none to tell me to but Thee
881
I've none to tell me to but Thee
So when Thou failest, nobody.
It was a little tie-
It just held Two, nor those it held
Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled
Beyond my Boundary-
If things were opposite-and Me
And Me it were-that ebbed from Thee
On some unanswering Shore-
Would'st Thou seek so-just say
That I the Answer may pursue
Unto the lips it eddied through-
So-overtaking Thee-
$I've nothing else—to bring, You know
224
I've nothing else—to bring, You know—
So I keep bringing These—
Just as the Night keeps fetching Stars
To our familiar eyes—
Maybe, we shouldn't mind them—
Unless they didn't come—
Then—maybe, it would puzzle us
To find our way Home—
$I've seen a Dying Eye

Without disclosing what it be

$Joy to have merited the Pain
788
Joy to have merited the Pain-
To merit the Release-
Joy to have perished every step-
To Compass Paradise-
Pardon-to look upon thy face-
With these old fashioned Eyes-
Better than new-could be-for that-
Though bought in Paradise-
Because they looked on thee before-
And thou hast looked on them-
Prove Me-My Hazel Witnesses
The features are the same-
So fleet thou wert, when present-
So infinite-when gone-
An Orient's Apparition-
Remanded of the Morn-
The Height I recollect-
'Twas even with the Hills-
The Depth upon my Soul was notched-
As Floods-on Whites of Wheels-
To Haunt-till Time have dropped
His last Decade away,
And Haunting actualize-to last
At least-Eternity-

160
Just lost, when I was saved!
Just felt the world go by!
Just girt me for the onset with Eternity,
When breath blew back,
And on the other side
I heard recede the disappointed tide!
Therefore, as One returned, I feel
Odd secrets of the line to tell!
Some Sailor, skirting foreign shores-
Some pale Reporter, from the awful doors
Before the Seal!
Next time, to stay!
Next time, the things to see
By Ear unheard,
Unscrutinized by Eye-
Next time, to tarry,
While the Ages steal-
Slow tramp the Centuries,
And the Cycles wheel!

But was not wiser

Nor Logarithm Show

Ah, to be erudite
Enough to know!

If it be invention
It must have a Patent.

Precisely, as to you.

But Blank-and steady Wilderness-
Diversified by Night-
Just Infinites of Nought-
As far as it could see-
So looked the face I looked upon-
So looked itself-on Me-
I offered it no Help-
Because the Cause was Mine-
The Misery a Compact
As hopeless-as divine-
Neither-would be absolved-
Neither would be a Queen
Without the Other-Therefore-

But never deemed the dripping prize
Awaited their-low Brows-

Some rumor of Delirium,
No Summer-could-for Them-
Or Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred-
By Tropic Hint-some Travelled Bird
Imported to the Wood-
Or Wind's bright signal to the Ear-
Making that homely, and severe,
Contented, known, before-
The Heaven-unexpected come,
To Lives that thought the Worshipping
A too presumptuous Psalm-

Not found,

A jar across the flowers goes,
Their velvet masonry
Withstands until the sweet assault
Their chivalry consumes,
While he, victorious, tilts away
To vanquish other blooms.
His feet are shod with gauze,
His helmet is of gold;
His breast, a single onyx
With chrysoprase, inlaid.
His labor is a chant,
His idleness a tune;
Oh, for a bee's experience
Of clovers and of noon!

And then-upon the Hill-
And then abroad the World He go
To do His Golden Will-
And if His Yellow feet should miss-
The Bird would not arise-
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems-
No Bells have Paradise-
How dare I, therefore, stint a faith
On which so vast depends-
Lest Firmament should fail for me-
The Rivet in the Bands
$My first well Day—since many ill
574
My first well Day—since many ill—
I asked to go abroad,
And take the Sunshine in my hands,
And see the things in Pod—
A 'blossom just when I went in
To take my Chance with pain—
Uncertain if myself, or He,
Should prove the strongest One.
The Summer deepened, while we strove—
She put some flowers away—
And Redder cheeked Ones—in their stead—
A fond—illusive way—
To cheat Herself, it seemed she tried—
As if before a child
To fade—Tomorrow—Rainbows held
The Sepulchre, could hide.
She
She
She
And
dealt a fashion to the Nut—
tied the Hoods to Seeds—
dropped bright scraps of Tint, about—
left Brazilian Threads
On every shoulder that she met—
Then both her Hands of Haze
Put up—to hide her parting Grace
From our unfitted eyes.
My loss, by sickness—Was it Loss?
Or that Ethereal Gain
One earns by measuring the Grave—
Then—measuring the Sun—
$My friend attacks my friend!
118
My friend attacks my friend!
Oh Battle picturesque!
Then I turn Soldier too,
And he turns Satirist!
How martial is this place!
Had I a mighty gun
I think I'd shoot the human race
And then to glory run!
$My friend must be a Bird
92
My friend must be a Bird-
Because it flies!
Mortal, my friend must be,
Because it dies!
Barbs has it, like a Bee!
Ah, curious friend!
Thou puzzlest me!
$My Garden—like the Beach
484
My Garden—like the Beach—
Denotes there be—a Sea—
That's Summer—
Such as These—the Pearls
She fetches—such as Me
$My life closed twice
My life closed twice before its close--
It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil
A third event to me
So huge, so hopeless to conceive
As these that twice befell.
Parting is all we know of heaven,
And all we need of hell.
$My life had stood
My life had stood--a Loaded Gun--
In Corners--till a Day
The Owner passed--identified--
And carried Me away--
And now We roam in Sovereign Woods--
And now We hunt the Doe--
And every time I speak for Him--
The Mountains straight reply--
And do I smile, such cordial light
Upon the Valley glow--
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let its pleasure through--
And when at Night--Our good Day done--
I guard My Master's Head--
'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's
Deep Pillow--to have shared--
To foe of His--I'm deadly foe--
None stir the second time--
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye--
Or an emphatic Thumb--
Though I than He--may longer live
He longer must--than I--
For I have but the power to kill,
Without--the power to die--
$My nosegays are for captives;
My nosegays are for captives;
Dim, long-expectant eyes,
Fingers denied the plucking,
Patient till paradise.
To such, if they should whisper
Of morning and the moor,
They bear no other errand,
And I, no other prayer.
$My period had come for Prayer
564
My period had come for Prayer-
No other Art-would do-
My Tactics missed a rudiment-
Creator-Was it you?
God grows above-so those who pray
Horizons-must ascend-
And so I stepped upon the North
To see this Curious Friend-
His House was not-no sign had He-
By Chimney-nor by Door
Could I infer his Residence-
Vast Prairies of Air
Unbroken by a Settler-
Were all that I could see-
Infinitude-Had'st Thou no Face
That I might look on Thee?
The Silence condescended-
Creation stopped-for Me-
But awed beyond my errand-
I worshipped-did not "pray"-
$My Portion is Defeat—today
639
My Portion is Defeat—today—
A paler luck than Victory—
Less Paeans—fewer Bells—
The Drums don't follow Me—with tunes—
Defeat—a somewhat slower—means—
More Arduous than Balls—
'Tis populous with Bone and stain—
And Men too straight to stoop again—,
And Piles of solid Moan—
And Chips of Blank—in Boyish Eyes—
And scraps of Prayer—
And Death's surprise,
Stamped visible—in Stone—
There's somewhat prouder, over there—
The Trumpets tell it to the Air—
How different Victory
To Him who has it—and the One
Who to have had it, would have been
Contender—to die—
$My Reward for Being, was This
343
My Reward for Being, was This.
My premium-My Bliss-
An Admiralty, less-
A Sceptre-penniless-
And Realms-just Dross-
When Thrones accost my Hands-
With "Me, Miss, Me"-
I'll unroll Thee-
Dominions dowerless-beside this Grace-
Election-Vote-
The Ballots of Eternity, will show just that.
$My River runs to thee
162
My River runs to thee-
Blue Sea! Wilt welcome me?

Oh Sea-look graciously-
I'll fetch thee Brooks
From spotted nooks-
Say-Sea-Take Me!
$My Soul—accused me—And I quailed
753
My Soul—accused me—And I quailed—
As Tongue of Diamond had reviled
All else accused me—and I smiled—
My Soul—that Morning—was My friend—
Her favor—is the best Disdain
Toward Artifice of Time—or Men—
But Her Disdain—'twere lighter bear
A finger of Enamelled Fire—
$My wheel is in the dark
10
My wheel is in the dark!
I cannot see a spoke
Yet know its dripping feet
Go round and round.
My foot is on the Tide!
An unfrequented road-
Yet have all roads
A clearing at the end-
Some have resigned the Loom-
Some in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ-
Some with new-stately feet-
Pass royal through the gate-
Flinging the problem back
At you and I!
$My Worthiness is all my Doubt
751
My Worthiness is all my Doubt-
His Merit-all my fear-
Contrasting which, my quality
Do lowlier-appear-
Lest I should insufficient prove
For His beloved Need-
The Chiefest Apprehension
Upon my thronging Mind-
'Tis true-that Deity to stoop
Inherently incline-
For nothing higher than Itself
Itself can rest upon-
So I-the undivine abode
Of His Elect Content-
Conform my Soul-as 'twere a Church,
Unto Her Sacrament-
$Myself was formed—a Carpenter
488
Myself was formed—a Carpenter—
An unpretending time
My Plane—and I, together wrought
Before a Builder came—
To measure our attainments—
Had we the Art of Boards
Sufficiently developed—He'd hire us
At Halves—
My Tools took Human—Faces—
The Bench, where we had toiled—
Against the Man—persuaded—
We—Temples build—I said—
$Nature and God—I neither knew
835
Nature and God—I neither knew
Yet Both so well knew me
They startled, like Executors
Of My identity.
Yet Neither told—that I could learn—
My Secret as secure
As Herschel's private interest
Or Mercury's affair—
$Nature is what we see—

The Hill—the Afternoon—

Nay—Nature is Heaven—

So impotent Our Wisdom is
To her Simplicity.
$Nature rarer uses yellow
Nature rarer uses yellow
Than another hue;
Saves she all of that for sunsets,--
Prodigal of blue,
Spending scarlet like a woman,
Yellow she affords
Only scantly and selectly,
Like a lover's words.
$Nature the gentlest mother is
Nature the gentlest mother is,
Impatient of no child,
The feeblest of the waywardest.
Her admonition mild
In forest and the hill
By traveller be heard,
Restraining rampant squirrel
Or too impetuous bird.
How fair her conversation
A summer afternoon,
Her household her assembly;
And when the sun go down,
Her voice among the aisles
Incite the timid prayer
Of the minutest cricket,
The most unworthy flower.
When all the children sleep,
She turns as long away
As will suffice tolight her lamps,
Then bending from the sky
With infinite affection
An infiniter care,
Her golden finger on her lip,
Wills silence everywhere.
$Nature-sometimes sears a Sapling

Nature-sometimes sears a Sapling-
Sometimes-scalps a Tree-

When they do not die-
Fainter Leaves-to Further Seasons-
Dumbly testify-

Die oftener-Not so vitally-

$New feet within my garden go

New feet within my garden go-
New fingers stir the sod-
A Troubadour upon the Elm
Betrays the solitude.
New children play upon the green-
New Weary sleep below-
And still the pensive Spring returns-
And still the punctual snow!

No Man can compass a Despair-
As round a Goalless Road
No faster than a Mile at once

Unconscious of the Width-
Unconscious that the Sun

So accurate the One
At estimating Pain-
Whose own-has just begun-
His ignorance-the Angel
That pilot Him along-

Won't you wish you'd spoken
To that dull Girl?

But won't you wish you'd spared one

$No Notice gave She, but a Change
804
No Notice gave She, but a Change-
No Message, but a Sigh-
For Whom, the Time did not suffice
That She should specify.
She was not warm, though Summer shone
Nor scrupulous of cold
Though Rime by Rime, the steady Frost
Upon Her Bosom piled-
Of shrinking ways-she did not fright
Though all the Village looked-
But held Her gravity aloft-
And met the gaze-direct-
And when adjusted like a Seed
In careful fitted Ground
Unto the Everlasting Spring
And hindered but a Mound
Her Warm return, if so she chose-
And We-imploring drew-
Removed our invitation by
As Some She never knew-
$No Other can reduce

There knits a bolder One-
You cannot prick with saw-
Nor pierce with Scimitar-

No easier divest-
And gain the Sky
Than mayest Thou-
Except Thyself may be

So's Liberty.

Nobody knows this little Rose-
It might a pilgrim be
Did I not take it from the ways
And lift it up to thee.
Only a Bee will miss it-
Only a Butterfly,
Hastening from far journey-
On its breast to lie-
Only a Bird will wonder-
Only a Breeze will sigh-
Ah Little Rose-how easy
For such as thee to die!
$None can experience sting

A Hoary Boy, I've known to drop
Whole statured-by the side
Of Junior of Fourscore-'twas Act
Not Period-that died.
$Not in this world to see his face

Sounds long, until I read the place
Where this is said to be
But just the primer to a life
Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
Clasped yet to him and me.
And yet, my primer suits me so
I would not choose a book to know
Than that, be sweeter wise;
Might some one else so learned be.
And leave me just my A B C,
Himself could have the skies.
$Not probable—The barest Chance

Not probable—The barest Chance—
A smile too few—a word too much
And far from Heaven as the Rest—

What if the Bird from journey far—
Confused by Sweets—as Mortals—are—
Forget the secret of His wing
And perish—but a Bough between—
Oh, Groping feet—
Oh Phantom Queen!

$Of all the souls that stand create

I have elected one.
When sense from spirit files away,
And subterfuge is done;
When that which is and that which was
Apart, intrinsic, stand,
And this brief tragedy of flesh
Is shifted like a sand;
When figures show their royal front
And mists are carved sway,--
Behold the atom I Feferred
To all the lists of clay!
$Of all the Sounds despatched abroad
321
Of all the Sounds despatched abroad,
There's not a Charge to me
Like that old measure in the Boughs-
That phraseless Melody-
The Wind does-working like a Hand,
Whose fingers Comb the Sky-
Then quiver down-with tufts of Tune-
Permitted Gods, and me-
Inheritance, it is, to us-
Beyond the Art to Earn-
Beyond the trait to take away
By Robber, since the Gain
Is gotten not of fingers-
And inner than the Bone-
Hid golden, for the whole of Days,
And even in the Urn,
I cannot vouch the merry Dust
Do not arise and play
In some odd fashion of its own,
Some quainter Holiday,
When Winds go round and round in Bands-
And thrum upon the door,
And Birds take places, overhead,
To bear them Orchestra.
I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs,
If such an Outcast be-
Who never heard that fleshless Chant-
Rise-solemn-on the Tree,
As if some Caravan of Sound
Off Deserts, in the Sky,
Had parted Rank,
Then knit, and swept-
In Seamless Company-

The General Heavens-upon-
It soars-and shifts-and whirls-
And measures with the Clouds
In easy-even-dazzling pace-

Except a Wake of Music
Accompany their feet-
As did the Down emit a Tune-
For Ecstasy-of it
$Of Bronze—and Blaze

So adequate—it forms—
So preconcerted with itself—
So distant—to alarms—
And Unconcern so sovereign
To Universe, or me—
Infects my simple spirit
With Taints of Majesty—
Till I take vaster attitudes—
And strut upon my stem—
Disdaining Men, and Oxygen,
For Arrogance of them—
My Splendors, are Menagerie—
But their Completeless Show
Will entertain the Centuries
When I, am long ago,
An Island in dishonored Grass—
Whom none but Beetles—know.

Of Brussels—it was not—
Of Kidderminster? Nay—

It was a gentle price—

Of Beggar—or of Bird—
Of small and spicy Yards—
In hue—a mellow Dun—
Of Sunshine—and of Sere—Composed—
But, principally—of Sun—
The Wind—unrolled it fast—
And spread it on the Ground—

To leave me in the Atom's Tomb—
Merry, and Nought, and gay, and numb—
Than this smart Misery.

Of nearness to her sundered Things
The Soul has special times-
When Dimness-looks the Oddity-
Distinctness-easy-seems-
The Shapes we buried, dwell about,
Familiar, in the Rooms-
Untarnished by the Sepulchre,
The Mouldering Playmate comes-
In just the Jacket that he wore-
Long buttoned in the Mold
Since we-old mornings, Children-played-
Divided-by a world-
The Grave yields back her Robberies-
The Years, our pilfered Things-
Bright Knots of Apparitions
Salute us, with their wings-
As we-it were-that perished-
Themself-had just remained till we rejoin them-
And 'twas they, and not ourself
That mourned.

Would seem to me the more the way
A Good News should be given.

Of Tribulation, these are They,
Denoted by the White-

Of Victors-designate-
All these-did conquer-
But the ones who overcame most times-
Wear nothing commoner than Snow-
No Ornament, but Palms-
Surrender-is a sort unknown-
On this superior soil-

Remembered, as the Mile
Our panting Ankle barely passed-
When Night devoured the Road-
But we-stood whispering in the House-
And all we said-was "Saved"!

Ourself-and Rectitude-
And that Assembly-not far off
From furthest Spirit-God-

On such a night, or such a night,
Would anybody care
If such a little figure
Slipped quiet from its chair-
So quiet-Oh how quiet,
That nobody might know
But that the little figure
Rocked softer-to and fro-
On such a dawn, or such a dawn-
Would anybody sigh
That such a little figure
Too sound asleep did lie
For Chanticleer to wake it-
Or stirring house below-
Or giddy bird in orchard-
Or early task to do?
There was a little figure plump
For every little knoll-
Busy needles, and spools of thread-
And trudging feet from school-
Playmates, and holidays, and nuts-
And visions vast and small-
Strange that the feet so precious charged
Should reach so small a goal!
$On that dear Frame the Years had worn

Yet precious as the House

Should softly place within our own
Denying that they died.

On this late Morn-the Sun-
The clouds-like listless Elephants-
Horizons-straggled down-
The Birds rose smiling, in their nests-
The gales-indeed-were done-
Alas, how heedless were the eyes-
On whom the summer shone!

No Daybreak-can bestir-
The slow-Archangel's syllables
Must awaken her!

It was the limit of my Dream-
The focus of my Prayer-
A perfect-paralyzing Bliss-
Contented as Despair-
I knew no more of Want-or Cold-
Phantasms both become
For this new Value in the Soul-
Supremest Earthly Sum-
The Heaven below the Heaven above-
Obscured with ruddier Blue-
Life's Latitudes leant over-full-
The Judgment perished-too-

Why Paradise defer-
Why Floods be served to Us-in Bowls-

As we ride grand along!

And claim the rank to die!

Although-I knew-to take it-
Would cost me-just a life!
The Sea is full-I know it!
That-does not blur my Gem!
It burns-distinct from all the row-
Intact-in Diadem!

That whiter host.
Far safer through an Abbey gallop,
The stones achase,
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
In lonesome place.

Be horror's least.

He bolts the door,
O'erlooking a superior spectre
More near.

There's only one recorded,
But both belong to me.
One came the road that I came-
And wore my last year's gown-
The other, as a bird her nest,
Builded our hearts among.
She did not sing as we did-
It was a different tune-
Herself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.
Today is far from Childhood-
But up and down the hills
I held her hand the tighter-
Which shortened all the miles-
And still her hum
The years among,
Deceives the Butterfly;
Still in her Eye
The Violets lie
Mouldered this many May.
I spilt the dew-
But took the morn-
I chose this single star
From out the wide night's numbers-
Sue - forevermore!

One Year ago—jots what?
God—spell the word! I—can't—
Was't Grace? Not that—
Was't Glory? That—will do—
Spell slower—Glory—
Such Anniversary shall be—
Sometimes—not often—in Eternity—
When farther Parted, than the Common Woe—
Look—feed upon each other's faces—so—
In doubtful meal, if it be possible
Their Banquet's true—
I tasted—careless—then—
I did not know the Wine
Came once a World—Did you?
Oh, had you told me so—
This Thirst would blister—easier—now—
You said it hurt you—most—
Mine—was an Acorn's Breast—
And could not know how fondness grew
In Shaggier Vest—
Perhaps—I couldn't—
But, had you looked in—
A Giant—eye to eye with you, had been—
No Acorn—then—
So—Twelve months ago—
We breathed—
Then dropped the Air—
Which bore it best?
Was this—the patientest—
Because it was a Child, you know—
And could not value—Air?
If to be "Elder"—mean most pain—
I'm old enough, today, I'm certain—then—
As old as thee—how soon?
One—Birthday more—or Ten?

Ah, Sir, None!

Only a Shrine, but Mine-
I made the Taper shine-
Madonna dim, to whom all Feet may come,
Regard a Nun-
Thou knowest every Woe-
Needless to tell thee-so-
But can'st thou do
The Grace next to it-heal?
That looks a harder skill to us-
Still-just as easy, if it be thy Will
To thee-Grant me-
Thou knowest, though, so Why tell thee?

$Our journey had advanced;
Our journey had advanced;
Our feet were almost come
To that odd fork in Being's road,
Eternity by term.
Our pace took sudden awe,
Our feet reluctant led.
Before were cities, but between,
The forest of the dead.
Retreat was out of hope,--
Behind, a sealed route,
Eternity's white flag before,
And God at every gate.
$Our little Kinsmen—after Rain
885
Our little Kinsmen—after Rain
In plenty may be seen,
A Pink and Pulpy multitude
The tepid Ground upon.
A needless life, it seemed to me
Until a little Bird
As to a Hospitality
Advanced and breakfasted.
As I of He, so God of Me
I pondered, may have judged,
And left the little Angle Worm
With Modesties enlarged.
$Our Lives Are Swiss
Our lives are Swiss --
So still -- so Cool --
Till some odd afternoon
The Alps neglect their Curtains
And we look farther on!

While like a guard between --
The solemn Alps --
The siren Alps
Forever intervene!

Ourselves were wed one summer—dear—
Your Vision—was in June—
And when Your little Lifetime failed,
I wearied—too—of mine—
And overtaken in the Dark—
Where You had put me down—
By Some one carrying a Light—
I—too—received the Sign.
'Tis true—Our Futures different lay—
Your Cottage—faced the sun—
While Oceans—and the North must be—
On every side of mine
'Tis true, Your Garden led the Bloom,
For mine—in Frosts—was sown—
And yet, one Summer, we were Queens—
But You—were crowned in June—

Over and over, like a Tune-

But for the Justified Processions
At the Lord's Right hand.

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,

If you would like to borrow,

Why, I will lend until just then,
But not an hour more!

Velvet people from Vevay—
Balles from some lost summer day—

Paris could not lay the fold
Belted down with Emerald—
Venice could not show a check
Of a tint so lustrous meek—
Never such an Ambuscade
As of briar and leaf displayed
For my little damask maid—
I had rather wear her grace
Than an Earl's distinguished face—
I had rather dwell like her
Than be "Duke of Exeter"—
Royalty enough for me
To subdue the Bumblebee.

When Summer's Everlasting Dower—

Round some other face—

Just to follow Your dear future—

Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadences, --

When Hers had ceased to run-
When she had put away Her Work
My own had just begun.
I strove to weary Brain and Bone-
To harass to fatigue
The glittering Retinue of nerves-
Vitality to clog
To some dull comfort Those obtain
Who put a Head away
They knew the Hair to-
And forget the color of the Day-
Affliction would not be appeased-
The Darkness braced as firm
As all my stratagem had been
The Midnight to confirm-
No Drug for Consciousness-can be-
Alternative to die
Is Nature's only Pharmacy
For Being's Malady-

And the Troubadour.

She bore it till the simple veins
Traced azure on her hand-
Til pleading, round her quiet eyes
The purple Crayons stand.
Till Daffodils had come and gone
I cannot tell the sum,
And then she ceased to bear it-
And with the Saints sat down.
No more her patient figure
At twilight soft to meet-
No more her timid bonnet
Upon the village street-
But Crowns instead, and Courtiers-
And in the midst so fair,
Whose but her shy-immortal face
Of whom we're whispering here?

She dealt her pretty words like Blades-
How glittering they shone-
And every One unbared a Nerve
Or wantoned with a Bone-

How ill the Creatures bear-
To Ache is human-not polite-
The Film upon the eye
Mortality's old Custom-
Just locking up-to Die.

Her countenance as spray.

Her life had leaped away-
Intending to return-
But not so soon-

As if for lull of sport-
An instant had forgot-
The Trick to start-
Her dancing Eyes-ajar-
As if their Owner were
Still sparkling through
For fun-at you-

Devising, I am sure-
To force her sleep-
So light-so deep-

The Bough where she was born—
$She sweeps with many-colored brooms,

And leaves the shreds behind;
Oh, housewife in the evening west,
Come back, and dust the pond!
You dropped a purple ravelling in,
You dropped an amber thread;
And now you've littered all the East
With duds of emerald!
And still she plies her spotted brooms,
And still the aprons fly,
Till brooms fade softly into stars --
And then I come away.

To such a Fate-to Minister.

Oh caput cap-a-pie!
And oh "memento mori"
When I am far from thee!
Hurrah for Peter Parley!
Hurrah for Daniel Boone!
Three cheers, sir, for the gentleman
Who first observed the moon!
Peter, put up the sunshine;
Patti, arrange the stars;
Tell Luna, tea is waiting,
And call your brother Mars!
Put down the apple, Adam,
And come away with me,
So shalt thou have a pippin
From off my father's tree!
I climb the "Hill of Science,"
I "view the landscape o'er;"
Such transcendental prospect,
I ne'er beheld before!
Unto the Legislature
My country bids me go;
I'll take my india rubbers,
In case the wind should blow!
During my education,
It was announced to me
That gravitation, stumbling,
Fell from an apple tree!
The earth upon an axis
Was once supposed to turn,
By way of a gymnastic
In honor of the sun!
It was the brave Columbus,
A sailing o'er the tide,
Who notified the nations
Of where I would reside!
Mortality is fatal-
Gentility is fine,
Rascality, heroic,
Insolvency, sublime!
Our Fathers being weary,
Laid down on Bunker Hill;
And tho' full many a morning,
Yet they are sleeping still,-
The trumpet, sir, shall wake them,
In dreams I see them rise,
Each with a solemn musket
A marching to the skies!
A coward will remain, Sir,
Until the fight is done;
But an immortal hero
Will take his hat, and run!
Good bye, Sir, I am going;
My country calleth me;
Allow me, Sir, at parting,
To wipe my weeping e'e.
In token of our friendship
Accept this "Bonnie Doon,"
And when the hand that plucked it
Hath passed beyond the moon,
The memory of my ashes
Will consolation be;
Then, farewell, Tuscarora,
And farewell, Sir, to thee!

For whom I betrayed the Dell-

But I shall never tell!

So glad we are—a Stranger'd deem

So similar—An Optizan
Could not decide between—
$So has a Daisy vanished

From the fields today-

$So much Summer

So much Summer
Me for showing
Illegitimate-
Would a Smile's minute bestowing
Too exorbitant
To the Lady
With the Guinea
Look-if She should know

A Robin's Larder
Would suffice to stow-
$So proud she was to die
So proud she was to die
It made us all ashamed
That what we cherished, so unknown
To her desire seemed.
So satisfied to go
Where none of us should be,
Immediately, that anguish stooped
Almost to jealousy.

Some keep the Sabbath going to Church --
I keep it, staying at Home --
With a Bobolink for a Chorister --
And an Orchard, for a Dome --
Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice --
I just wear my Wings --
And instead of tolling the Bell, for Church,
Our little Sexton -- sings.
God preaches, a noted Clergyman --
And the sermon is never long,
So instead of getting to Heaven, at least --
I'm going, all along.

Some Rainbow—coming from the Fair!
Some Vision of the World Cashmere—

Or else a Peacock's purple Train
Feather by feather—on the plain
Fritters itself away!
The dreamy Butterflies bestir!
Lethargic pools resume the whir
Of last year's sundered tune!
From some old Fortress on the sun
Baronial Bees—march—one by one—
In murmuring platoon!
The Robins stand as thick today
As flakes of snow stood yesterday—
On fence—and Roof—and Twig!
The Orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover - Don the Sun!
Revisiting the Bog!
Without Commander! Countless! Still!
The Regiments of Wood and Hill
In bright detachment stand!
Behold! Whose Multitudes are these?
The children of whose turbaned seas—
Or what Circassian Land?

Some, too fragile for winter winds

Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Before their feet are cold.

Early aged, and often cold,
Sparrow, unnoticed by the Father-
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.

$Summer Shower
A drop fell on the apple tree,
Another on the roof;
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,
And made the gables laugh.
A few went out to help the brook,
That went to help the sea.
Myself conjectured, Were they pearls,
What necklaces could be!
The

And bathed them in the glee;

And signed the fete away.

As Stars that drop anonymous
From an abundant sky.

'T was just this time last year I died.
I know I heard the corn,
When I was carried by the farms,--
It had the tassels on.
I thought how yellow it would look
When Richard went to mill;
And then I wanted to get out,
But something held my will.
I thought just how red apples wedged
The stubble's joints between;
And carts went stooping round the fields
To take the pumpkins in.
I wondered which would miss me least,
And when Thanksgiving came,
If father'd multiply the plates
To make an even sum.
And if my stocking hung too high,
Would it blur the Christmas glee,
That not a Santa Claus could reach
The altitude of me?
But this sort grieved myself, and so
I thought how it would be
When just this time, some perfect year,
Themselves should come to me.

Because I could not stop for Death,
He kindly stopped for me;
The carriage held but just ourselves
And Immortality.
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away
My labor, and my leisure too,
For his civility.
We passed the school where children played,
Their lessons scarcely done;
We passed the fields of gazing grain,
We passed the setting sun.
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground;
The roof was scarcely visible.
The cornice but a mound.
Since then 'tis centuries; but each
Feels shorter than the day
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity.

A peace, as hemispheres at home,--
And so the night became.

The peace-the flight-the Amethyst-
Night's possibility!
$The Day Came Slow
The day came slow, till five o'clock,
Then sprang before the hills,
Like hindered rubies, or the light,
A sudden musket spills.
The purple could not keep the east.
The sunrise shook from fold.
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
The lady just unrolled.
The happy winds their timbrels took;
The birds in docile rows,
Arranged themselves around their prince.
(The wind is prince of those.)
The orchard sparkled like a Jew,---
How mighty 'twas to stay,
A guest in this stupendous place,
The parlor of the day.
$The Day that I was crowned
356
The Day that I was crowned
Was like the other Days-
Until the Coronation came-
And then-'twas Otherwise-
As Carbon in the Coal
And Carbon in the Gem
Are One-and yet the former
Were dull for Diadem-
I rose, and all was plain-
But when the Day declined
Myself and It, in Majesty
Were equally-adorned-
The Grace that I-was chose-
To Me-surpassed the Crown
That was the Witness for the Grace-
'Twas even that 'twas Mine-
$The Day undressed-Herself
716
The Day undressed-Herself-
Her Garter-was of Gold-
Her Petticoat-of Purple plain-
Her Dimities-as old
Exactly-as the World-
And yet the newest Star-
Enrolled upon the Hemisphere
Be wrinkled-much as Her-
Too near to God-to pray-
Too near to Heaven-to fear-
The Lady of the Occident
Retired without a care-
Her Candle so expire
The flickering be seen
On Ball of Mast in Bosporus-
And Dome-and Window Pane-
$The Definition of Beauty is
988
The Definition of Beauty is
That Definition is none-
Of Heaven, easing Analysis,
Since Heaven and He are one.
$The difference between Despair
305
The difference between Despair
And Fear-is like the One
Between the instant of a Wreck
And when the Wreck has been-
The Mind is smooth-no Motion-
Contented as the Eye
Upon the Forehead of a Bust-
That knows-it cannot see-
$The Doomed—regard the Sunrise
294
The Doomed—regard the Sunrise
With different Delight—
Because—when next it burns abroad
They doubt to witness it—
The Man—to die—tomorrow—
Harks for the Meadow Bird—
Because its Music stirs the Axe
That clamors for his head—
Joyful—to whom the Sunrise
Precedes Enamored—Day—
Joyful—for whom the Meadow Bird
Has ought but Elegy!
$The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea
284
The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea-
Forgets her own locality-
As I-toward Thee-
She knows herself an incense small-
Yet small-she sighs-if All-is All-
How larger-be?
The Ocean-smiles-at her Conceit-
But she, forgetting Amphitrite-
Pleads-"Me"?
$The Dust behind I strove to join
992
The Dust behind I strove to join
Unto the Disk before-
But Sequence ravelled out of Sound
Like Balls upon a Floor-
$The dying need but little, dear,--
The dying need but little, dear,--
A glass of water's all,
A flower's unobtrusive face
To punctuate the wall,
A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,
And certainly that one
No color in the rainbow
Perceives when you are gone.
$The face I carry with me—last
336
The face I carry with me—last—
When I go out of Time—
To take my Rank—by—in the West—
That face—will just be thine—
I'll hand it to the Angel—
That—Sir—was my Degree—
In Kingdoms—you have heard the Raised—
Refer to—possibly.
He'll take it—scan it—step aside—
Return—with such a crown
As Gabriel—never capered at—
And beg me put it on—
And then—he'll turn me round and round—
To an admiring sky—
As one that bore her Master's name—
Sufficient Royalty!
$The feet of people walking home
7
The feet of people walking home
With gayer sandals go-
The Crocus- til she rises
The Vassal of the snow-
The lips at Hallelujah
Long years of practise bore
Til bye and bye these Bargemen
Walked singing on the shore.
Pearls are the Diver's farthings
Extorted from the Sea-
Pinions- the Seraph's wagon
Pedestrian once- as we-
Night is the morning's Canvas
Larceny- legacy-
Death, but our rapt attention
To Immortality.
My figures fail to tell me
How far the Village lies-
Whose peasants are the Angels-
Whose Cantons dot the skies-
My Classics veil their faces-
My faith that Dark adores-
Which from its solemn abbeys
Such ressurection pours.
$The Fingers of the Light
1000
The Fingers of the Light
Tapped soft upon the Town
With "I am great and cannot wait
So therefore let me in."
"You're soon," the Town replied,
"My Faces are asleep-
But swear, and I will let you by,
You will not wake them up."
The easy Guest complied
But once within the Town
The transport of His Countenance
Awakened Maid and Man
The Neighbor in the Pool
Upon His Hip elate
Made loud obeisance and the Gnat
Held up His Cup for Light.
$The first Day that I was a Life
902
The first Day that I was a Life
I recollect it-How still-
That last Day that I was a Life
I recollect it-as well-
'Twas stiller-though the first
Was still-
"Twas empty-but the first
Was full-
This-was my finallest Occasion-
But then
My tenderer Experiment
Toward Men-
"Which choose I"?
That-I cannot say-
"Which choose They"?
Question Memory!
$The first Day's Night had come
410
The first Day's Night had come-
And grateful that a thing
So terrible-had been endured-
I told my Soul to sing-
She said her Strings were snapt-
Her Bow-to Atoms blown-
And so to mend her-gave me work
Until another Morn-
And then-a Day as huge
As Yesterdays in pairs,
Unrolled its horror in my face-
Until it blocked my eyes-
My Brain-begun to laugh-
I mumbled-like a fool-
And tho' 'tis Years ago-that Day-
My Brain keeps giggling-still.
And Something's odd-within-
That person that I was-
And this One-do not feel the same-
Could it be Madness-this?
$The Flower must not blame the Bee
206
The Flower must not blame the Bee-
That seeketh his felicity
Too often at her door-
But teach the Footman from Vevay-
Mistress is "not at home"-to say-
To people-any more!
$The Future—never spoke
672
The Future—never spoke—
Nor will He—like the Dumb—
Reveal by sign—a syllable
Of His Profound To Come—
But when the News be ripe—
Presents it—in the Act—
Forestalling Preparation—
Escape—or Substitute—
Indifference to Him—
The Dower—as the Doom—
His Office—but to execute
Fate's—Telegram—to Him—
$The Gentian weaves her fringes
18
The Gentian weaves her fringes-
The Maple's loom is red-
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.
A brief, but patient illness-
An hour to prepare,
And one below this morning
Is where the angels are-
It was a short procession,
The Bobolink was there-
An aged Bee addressed us-
And then we knelt in prayer-
We trust that she was willing-
We ask that we may be.
Summer-Sister-Seraph!
Let us go with thee!
In the name of the Bee-
And of the Butterfly-
And of the Breeze-Amen!

The good Will of a Flower
The Man who would possess
Must first present
Certificate
Of minted Holiness.

The Grace—Myself—might not obtain—
Confer upon My flower—
Refracted but a Countenance—
For I—inhabit Her—
$The Grass so little has to do
The Grass so little has to do –
A Sphere of simple Green –
With only Butterflies to brood
And Bees to entertain –
And stir all day to pretty Tunes
The Breezes fetch along –
And hold the Sunshine in its lap
And bow to everything –
And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearls –
And make itself so fine
A Duchess were too common
For such a noticing –
And even when it dies – to pass
In Odors so divine –
Like Lowly spices, lain to sleep –
Or Spikenards, perishing –
And then, in Sovereign Barns to dwell –
And dream the Days away,
The Grass so little has to do
I wish I were a Hay –
$The Guest is gold and crimson
15
The Guest is gold and crimson-
An Opal guest and gray-
Of Ermine is his doublet-
His Capuchin gay-
He reaches town at nightfall-
He stops at every door-
Who looks for him at morning
I pray him too-explore
The Lark's pure territory-
Or the Lapwing's shore!
$The hallowing of Pain
772
The hallowing of Pain
Like hallowing of Heaven,
Obtains at a corporeal cost-
The Summit is not given
To Him who strives severe
At middle of the Hill-
But He who has achieved the Top-
All-is the price of All-
$The heart asks pleasure first
The heart asks pleasure first
And then, excuse from pain-
And then, those little anodynes
That deaden suffering;
And then, to go to sleep;
And then, if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor,
The liberty to die.
$The Heart has narrow Banks
928
The Heart has narrow Banks
It measures like the Sea
In mighty-unremitting Bass
And Blue Monotony
Till Hurricane bisect
And as itself discerns
Its sufficient Area
The Heart convulsive learns
That Calm is but a Wall
Of unattempted Gauze
An instant's Push demolishes
A Questioning-dissolves.
$The Heaven vests for Each
694
The Heaven vests for Each
In that small Deity
It craved the grace to worship
Some bashful Summer's Day-
Half shrinking from the Glory
It importuned to see
Till these faint Tabernacles drop
In full Eternity-
How imminent the Venture-
As one should sue a Star-
For His mean sake to leave the Row
And entertain Despair-
A Clemency so common-
We almost cease to fear-
Enabling the minutest-
And furthest-to adore-
$The Himmaleh was known to stoop
481
The Himmaleh was known to stoop
Unto the Daisy low-
Transported with Compassion
That such a Doll should grow
Where Tent by Tent-Her Universe
Hung out its Flags of Snow-
$The Hollows round His eager Eyes
955
The Hollows round His eager Eyes
Were Pages where to read
Pathetic Histories-although
Himself had not complained.
Biography to All who passed
Of Unobtrusive Pain
Except for the italic Face
Endured, unhelped-unknown.
$The Judge is like the Owl
699
The Judge is like the Owl-
I've heard my Father tell-
And Owls do build in Oaks-
So here's an Amber Sill-
That slanted in my Path-
When going to the Barn-
And if it serve You for a House-
Itself is not in vain-
About the price-'tis small-
I only ask a Tune
At Midnight-Let the Owl select
His favorite Refrain.
$The Juggler's Hat her Country is

The Mountain Gorse-the Bee's!
$The Lady feeds Her little Bird
941
The Lady feeds Her little Bird
At rarer intervals-
The little Bird would not dissent
But meekly recognize
The Gulf between the Hand and Her
And crumbless and afar
And fainting, on Her yellow Knee
Fall softly, and adore-
$The Lamp burns sure—within
233
The Lamp burns sure—within—
Tho' Serfs—supply the Oil—
It matters not the busy Wick—
At her phosphoric toil!
The Slave—forgets—to fill—
The Lamp—burns golden—on—
Unconscious that the oil is out—
As that the Slave—is gone.
$The last Night that She lived
1100
The last Night that She lived
It was a Common Night
Except the Dying-this to Us
Made Nature different
We noticed smallest things-
Things overlooked before
By this great light upon our Minds
Italicized-as 'twere.
As We went out and in
Between Her final Room
And Rooms where Those to be alive
Tomorrow were, a Blame
That Others could exist
While She must finish quite
A Jealousy for Her arose
So nearly infinite-
We waited while She passed-
It was a narrow time-
Too jostled were Our Souls to speak
At length the notice came.
She mentioned, and forgot-
Then lightly as a Reed
Bent to the Water, struggled scarce-
Consented, and was dead-
And We-We placed the Hair-
And drew the Head erect-
And then an awful leisure was
Belief to regulate-
$The Leaves like Women interchange
987
The Leaves like Women interchange
Exclusive Confidence-
Somewhat of nods and somewhat
Portentous inference.
The Parties in both cases
Enjoining secrecy-
Inviolable compact
To notoriety.
$The Loneliness One dare not sound
777
The Loneliness One dare not sound-
And would as soon surmise
As in its Grave go plumbing
To ascertain the size-
The Loneliness whose worst alarm
Is lest itself should see-
And perish from before itself
For just a scrutiny-
The Horror not to be surveyed-
But skirted in the Dark-
With Consciousness suspended-
And Being under Lock-
I fear me this-is Loneliness-
The Maker of the soul
Its Caverns and its Corridors
Illuminate-or seal-
$The lonesome for they know not What
262
The lonesome for they know not What-
The Eastern Exiles-be-
Who strayed beyond the Amber line
Some madder Holiday-
And ever since-the purple Moat
They strive to climb-in vain-
As Birds-that tumble from the clouds
Do fumble at the strain-
The Blessed Ether-taught them-
Some Transatlantic Morn-
When Heaven-was too common-to miss-
Too sure-to dote upon!
$The Love a Life can show Below
673
The Love a Life can show Below
Is but a filament, I know,
Of that diviner thing
That faints upon the face of Noon-
And smites the Tinder in the Sun-
And hinders Gabriel's Wing-
'Tis this-in Music-hints and sways-
And far abroad on Summer days-
Distils uncertain pain-
'Tis this enamors in the East-
And tints the Transit in the West
With harrowing Iodine-
'Tis this-invites-appalls-endows-
Flits-glimmers-proves-dissolves-
Returns-suggests-convicts-enchants-
Then-flings in Paradise-
$The Luxury to apprehend
815
The Luxury to apprehend
The Luxury 'twould be
To look at Thee a single time
An Epicure of Me
In whatsoever Presence makes
Till for a further Food
I scarcely recollect to starve
So first am I supplied-
The Luxury to meditate
The Luxury it was
To banguet on thy Countenance
A Sumptuousness bestows
On plainer Days, whose Table far
As Certainty can see
Is laden with a single Crumb
The Consciousness of Thee.
$The Malay—took the Pearl

The Malay—took the Pearl—
Not—I—the Earl—
I—feared the Sea—too much
Unsanctified—to touch—
Praying that I might be
Worthy—the Destiny—
The Swarthy fellow swam—
And bore my Jewel—Home—
Home to the Hut! What lot
Had I—the Jewel—got—
Borne on a Dusky Breasty—
I had not deemed a Vest
Of Amber—fit—
The Negro never knew
I—wooed it—too—
To gain, or be undone—
Alike to Him—One—
$The Manner of its Death
468
The Manner of its Death
When Certain it must die-
'Tis deemed a privilege to choose-
'Twas Major Andre's Way-
When Choice of Life-is past-
There yet remains a Love
Its little Fate to stipulate-
How small in those who live-
The Miracle to tease
With Bable of the styles-
How "they are Dying mostly-now"-
And Customs at "St. James"!
$The Martyr Poets—did not tell
544
The Martyr Poets—did not tell—
But wrought their Pang in syllable—
That when their mortal name be numb—
Their mortal fate—encourage Some—
The Martyr Painters—never spoke—
Bequeathing—rather—to their Work—
That when their conscious fingers cease—
Some seek in Art—the Art of Peace—
$The Missing All—prevented Me
985
The Missing All—prevented Me
From missing minor Things.
If nothing larger than a World's
Departure from a Hinge—
Or Sun's extinction, be observed—
'Twas not so large that I
Could lift my Forehead from my work
For Curiosity.
$The Months have ends—the Years—a knot
423
The Months have ends—the Years—a knot—
No Power can untie
To stretch a little further
A Skein of Misery—
The Earth lays back these tired lives
In her mysterious Drawers—
Too tenderly, that any doubt
An ultimate Repose—
The manner of the Children—
Who weary of the Day—
Themself—the noisy Plaything
They cannot put away—
$The Moon was but a Chin of Gold

The Moon was but a Chin of Gold
A Night or two ago-
And now she turns Her perfect Face
Upon the World below-
Her Forehead is of Amplest Blonde-
Her Cheek-a Beryl hewn-
Her Eye unto the Summer Dew
The likest I have known-
Her Lips of Amber never part-
But what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver Will-
And what a privilege to be
But the remotest Star-
For Certainty She take Her Way
Beside Your Palace Door-
Her Bonnet is the Firmament-
The Universe-Her Shoe-
The Stars-the Trinkets at Her Belt-
Her Dimities-of Blue-
$The Morning after Woe
364
The Morning after Woe-
'Tis frequently the Way-
Surpasses all that rose before-
For utter Jubilee-
As Nature did not care-
And piled her Blossoms on-
And further to parade a Joy
Her Victim stared upon-
The Birds declaim their Tunes-
Pronouncing every word
Like Hammers-Did they know they fell
Like Litanies of Lead-
On here and there-a creature-
They'd modify the Glee
To fit some Crucifixal Clef-
Some Key of Calvary-

Lest I should be old fashioned
I'll put a trinket on.
$The Mountain sat upon the Plain

The Mountain sat upon the Plain
In his tremendous Chair-

His inquest, everywhere-
The Seasons played around his knees
Like Children round a sire-

Of Dawn, the Ancestor-
$The Mountains—grow unnoticed

The Mountains—grow unnoticed—
Their Purple figures rise
Without attempt—Exhaustion—
Assistance—or Applause—
In Their Eternal Faces
The Sun—with just delight
Looks long—and last—and golden—
For fellowship—at night—
$The Murmur of a Bee
155
The Murmur of a Bee
A Witchcraft-yieldeth me-
If any ask me why-
'Twere easier to die-
Than tell-
The Red upon the Hill
Taketh away my will-
If anybody sneer-
Take care-for God is here-
That's all.
The Breaking of the Day
Addeth to my Degree-
If any ask me how-
Artist-who drew me so-
Must tell!
$The Mystery of Pain
Pain has an element of blank;
It cannot recollect
When it began, or if there were
A day when it was not.
It has no future but itself,
Its infinite realms contain
Its past, enlightened to perceive
New periods of pain.
$The name-of it-is "Autumn"

The name-of it-is "Autumn"-
The hue-of it-is Blood-
An Artery-upon the Hill-
A Vein-along the Road-
Great Globules-in the Alleys-
And Oh, the Shower of Stain-
When Winds-upset the Basin-
And spill the Scarlet Rain-
It sprinkles Bonnets-far below-
It gathers ruddy Pools-
Then-eddies like a Rose-away-
Upon Vermilion Wheels-
$The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
The heaven we chase
Like the June bee
Before the school-boy
Invites the race;
Stoops to an easy clover
Dips--evades--teases--deploys;
Then to the royal clouds
Lifts his light pinnace
Heedless of the boy
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.
Homesick for steadfast honey,
Ah! the bee flies not
That brews that rare variety.
$The Night was wide, and furnished scant
589
The Night was wide, and furnished scant
With but a single Star-
That often as a Cloud it met-
Blew out itself-for fear-
The Wind pursued the little Bush-
And drove away the Leaves
November left-then clambered up
And fretted in the Eaves-
No Squirrel went abroad-
A Dog's belated feet
Like intermittent Plush, he heard
Adown the empty Street-
To feel if Blinds be fast-
And closer to the fire-
Her little Rocking Chair to draw-
And shiver for the Poor-
The Housewife's gentle Task-
How pleasanter-said she
Unto the Sofa opposite-
The Sleet-than May, no Thee-
$The One who could repeat the Summer day

The One who could repeat the Summer day-
Were greater than itself-though He

When Orient have been outgrown
And Occident-become Unknown-
His Name-remain-
$The only ghost I ever saw
The only ghost I ever saw
Was dressed in mechlin, --so;
He wore no sandal on his foot,
And stepped like flakes of snow.
His gait was soundless, like the bird,
But rapid, like the roe;
His fashions quaint, mosaic,
Or, haply, mistletoe.
Hi conversation seldom,
His laughter like the breeze
That dies away in dimples
Among the pensive trees.
Our interview was transient, --
Of me, himself was shy;
And God forbid I look behind
Since that appalling day!

If Other News there be-
Or Admirable Show-
I'll tell it You-
$The Outer—from the Inner

The Outer—from the Inner
Derives its Magnitude—
'Tis Duke, or Dwarf, according
As is the Central Mood—
The fine—unvarying Axis
That regulates the Wheel—
Though Spokes—spin—more conspicuous
And fling a dust—the while.
The Inner—paints the Outer—
The Brush without the Hand—
Its Picture publishes—precise—
As is the inner Brand—
On fine—Arterial Canvas—
A Cheek—perchance a Brow—
The Star's whole Secret—in the Lake—
Eyes were not meant to know.

But He that hath endured

That Man-be qualified
To qualify Despair
To Those who failing new-
Mistake Defeat for Death-Each time-
Till acclimated-to-
$The Railway Train
I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step
Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare
To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down the hill
And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop - docile and omnipotent -
At its own stable door.
$The rainbow never tells me

The rainbow never tells me
That gust and storm are by,
Yet is she more convincing

Yet eloquent declare

Except the birds were here!

Never yet—consumed—

The Robin is the One
That interrupt the Morn
With hurried-few-express Reports
When March is scarcely on-
The Robin is the One
That overflow the Noon
With her cherubic quantity-
An April but begun-
The Robin is the One
That speechless from her Nest
Submit that Home-and Certainty
And Sanctity, are best
$The Robin's my Criterion for Tune
285
The Robin's my Criterion for Tune-
Because I grow-where Robins do-
But, were I Cuckoo born-
I'd swear by him-
The ode familiar-rules the Noon-
The Buttercup's, my Whim for Bloom-
Because, we're Orchard sprung-
But, were I Britain born,
I'd Daisies spurn-
None but the Nut-October fit-
Because, through dropping it,
The Seasons flit-I'm taught-
Without the Snow's Tableau
Winter, were lie-to me-
Because I see-New Englandly-
The Queen, discerns like me-
Provincially-
$The Rose did caper on her cheek
208
The Rose did caper on her cheek-
Her Bodice rose and fell-
Her pretty speech-like drunken men-
Did stagger pitiful-
Her fingers fumbled at her work-
Her needle would not go-
What ailed so smart a little Maid-
It puzzled me to know-
Till opposite-I spied a cheek
That bore another Rose-
Just opposite-Another speech
That like the Drunkard goes-
A Vest that like her Bodice, danced-
To the immortal tune-
Till those two troubled-little Clocks
Ticked softly into one.
$The Service without Hope
779
The Service without Hope-
Is tenderest, I think-
Because 'tis unsustained
By stint-Rewarded Work-
Has impetus of Gain-
And impetus of Goal-
There is no Diligence like that
That knows not an Until-

But they that go.

Both went to see.

The Skies can't keep their secret!
They tell it to the Hills-
The Hills just tell the Orchards-
And they-the Daffodils!
A Bird-by chance-that goes that way-
Soft overhears the whole-
If I should bribe the little Bird-
Who knows but she would tell?
I think I won't-however-
It's finer-not to know-
If Summer were an Axiom-
What sorcery had Snow?
So keep your secret-Father!
I would not-if I could,
Know what the Sapphire Fellows, do,
In your new-fashioned world!
$The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
The sky is low, the clouds are mean,
A travelling flake of snow

How some one treated him;
Nature, like us, is sometimes caught
Without her diadem.

The Soul has Bandaged moments-
When too appalled to stir-
She feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at her-
Salute her-with long fingers-
Caress her freezing hair-
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover-hovered-o'er-
Unworthy, that a thought so mean
Accost a Theme-so-fair-
The soul has moments of Escape-
When bursting all the doors-
She dances like a Bomb, abroad,
And swings upon the Hours,
As do the Bee-delirious borne-
Long Dungeoned from his Rose-
Touch Liberty-then know no more,
But Noon, and Paradise-
The Soul's retaken moments-
When, Felon led along,
With shackles on the plumed feet,
And staples, in the Song,
The Horror welcomes her, again,
These, are not brayed of Tongue-
$The Soul Selects Her Own Society
The Soul selects her own Society --
Then -- shuts the Door --
To her divine Majority --
Present no more --
Unmoved -- she notes the Chariots -- pausing --
At her low Gate --
Unmoved -- an Emperor be kneeling
Upon her Mat --
I've known her -- from an ample nation --
Choose One --
Then -- close the Valves of her attention --
Like Stone --
$The Soul that hath a Guest
674
The Soul that hath a Guest
Doth seldom go abroad-
Diviner Crowd at Home-
Obliterate the need-
And Courtesy forbid
A Host's departure when
Upon Himself be visiting
The Emperor of Men-
$The Soul unto itself (683)
The Soul unto itself
Is an imperial friend --
Or the most agonizing Spy --
An Enemy -- could send --
Secure against its own --
No treason it can fear --
Itself -- its Sovereign -- of itself
The Soul should stand in Awe --
$The Soul's distinct connection
974
The Soul's distinct connection
With immortality
Is best disclosed by Danger
Or quick Calamity-
As Lightning on a Landscape
Exhibits Sheets of Place-
Not yet suspected-but for Flash-
And Click-and Suddenness.
$The Soul's Superior instants
306
The Soul's Superior instants
Occur to Her-alone-
When friend-and Earth's occasion
Have infinite withdrawn-
Or She-Herself-ascended
To too remote a Height
For lower Recognition
Than Her Omnipotent-
This Mortal Abolition
Is seldom-but as fair
As Apparition-subject
To Autocratic Air-
Eternity's disclosure
To favorites-a few-
Of the Colossal substance
Of Immortality
$The Spider holds a Silver Ball
The spider holds a Silver Ball
In unperceived Hands--
And dancing softly to Himself
His Yarn of Pearl--unwinds--
He plies from Nought to Nought--
In unsubstantial Trade--
Supplants our Tapestries with His--
In half the period--
An Hour to rear supreme
His Continents of Light--
Then dangle from the Housewife's Broom--
His Boundaries--forgot--
$The Spirit is the Conscious Ear
733
The Spirit is the Conscious Ear.
We actually Hear
When We inspect-that's audible-
That is admitted-Here-
For other Services-as Sound-
There hangs a smaller Ear
Outside the Castle-that Contain-
The other-only-Hear-
$The Sun and Moon must make their haste
871
The Sun and Moon must make their haste-
The Stars express around
For in the Zones of Paradise
The Lord alone is burned-
His Eye, it is the East and West-
The North and South when He
Do concentrate His Countenance
Like Glow Worms, flee away-
Oh Poor and Far-
Oh Hindred Eye
That hunted for the Day-
The Lord a Candle entertains
Entirely for Thee-
$The Sun is gay or stark
878
The Sun is gay or stark
According to our Deed.
If Merry, He is merrier-
If eager for the Dead
Or an expended Day
He helped to make too bright
His mighty pleasure suits Us not
It magnifies our Freight
$The Sun kept setting—setting—still
692
The Sun kept setting—setting—still
No Hue of Afternoon—
Upon the Village I perceived
From House to House 'twas Noon—
The Dusk kept dropping—dropping—still
No Dew upon the Grass—
But only on my Forehead stopped—
And wandered in my Face—
My Feet kept drowsing—drowsing—still
My fingers were awake—
Yet why so little sound—Myself
Unto my Seeming—make?
How well I knew the Light before—
I could see it now—
'Tis Dying—I am doing—but
I'm not afraid to know—
$The Sun kept stooping—stooping
152
The Sun kept stooping—stooping—low!
The Hills to meet him rose!
On his side, what Transaction!
On their side, what Repose!
Deeper and deeper grew the stain
Upon the window pane—
Thicker and thicker stood the feet
Until the Tyrian
Was crowded dense with Armies—
So gay, so Brigadier—
That I felt martial stirrings
Who once the Cockade wore—
Charged from my chimney corner—
But Nobody was there!
$The Sun—just touched the Morning
232
The Sun—just touched the Morning—
The Morning—Happy thing—
Supposed that He had come to dwell—
And Life would all be Spring!
She felt herself supremer—
A Raised—Ethereal Thing!
Henceforth—for Her—What Holiday!
Meanwhile—Her wheeling King—
Trailed—slow—along the Orchards—
His haughty—spangled Hems—
Leaving a new necessity!
The want of Diadems!
The Morning—fluttered—staggered—
Felt feebly—for Her Crown—
Her unanointed forehead—
Henceforth—Her only One!
$The Sunrise runs for Both
710
The Sunrise runs for Both-
The East-Her Purple Troth
Keeps with the Hill-
The Noon unwinds Her Blue
Till One Breadth cover Two-
Remotest-still-
Nor does the Night forget
A Lamp for Each-to set-
Wicks wide away-
The North-Her blazing Sign
Erects in Iodine-
Till Both-can see-
The Midnight's Dusky Arms
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes
And so
Upon Her Bosom-One-
And One upon Her Hem-
Both lie-
$The Sunset stopped on Cottages
950
The Sunset stopped on Cottages
Where Sunset hence must be
For treason not of His, but Life's,
Gone Westerly, Today-
The Sunset stopped on Cottages
Where Morning just begun-
What difference, after all, Thou mak'st
Thou supercilious Sun?
$The sweetest Heresy received
387
The sweetest Heresy received
That Man and Woman know-

Though the Faith accommodate but Two-

The Ritual-so small-
The Grace so unavoidable-
To fail-is Infidel-
$The Test of Love—is Death

The Test of Love—is Death—
Our Lord—"so loved"—it saith—
What Largest Lover—hath

Through fainter Nerve—

And overlook—the Dust—

The thought beneath so slight a film
Is more distincly seen, --
As laces just reveal the surge,
Or mists the Apennine.
$The Tint I cannot take—is best
627
The Tint I cannot take—is best—
The Color too remote
That I could show it in Bazaar—
A Guinea at a sight—
The fine—impalpable Array—
That swaggers on the eye
Like Cleopatra's Company—
Repeated—in the sky—
The Moments of Dominion
That happen on the Soul
And leave it with a Discontent
Too exquisite—to tell—
The eager look—on Landscapes—
As if they just repressed
Some Secret—that was pushing
Like Chariots—in the Vest—
The Pleading of the Summer—
That other Prank—of Snow—
That Cushions Mystery with Tulle,
For fear the Squirrels—know.
Their Graspless manners—mock us—
Until the Cheated Eye
Shuts arrogantly—in the Grave—
Another way—to see—
$The Trees like Tassels—hit—and swung
606
The Trees like Tassels—hit—and swung—
There seemed to rise a Tune
From Miniature Creatures
Accompanying the Sun—
Far Psalteries of Summer—
Enamoring the Ear
They never yet did satisfy—
Remotest—when most fair
The Sun shone whole at intervals—
Then Half—then utter hid—
As if Himself were optional
And had Estates of Cloud
Sufficient to enfold Him
Eternally from view—
Except it were a whim of His
To let the Orchards grow—
A Bird sat careless on the fence—
One gossipped in the Lane
On silver matters charmed a Snake
Just winding round a Stone—
Bright Flowers slit a Calyx
And soared upon a Stem
Like Hindered Flags—Sweet hoisted—
With Spices—in the Hem—
'Twas more—I cannot mention—
How mean—to those that see—
Vandyke's Delineation
Of Nature's—Summer Day!
$The Truth—is stirless
780
The Truth—is stirless—
Other force—may be presumed to move—
This—then—is best for confidence—
When oldest Cedars swerve—
And Oaks untwist their fists—
And Mountains—feeble—lean—
How excellent a Body, that
Stands without a Bone—
How vigorous a Force
That holds without a Prop—
Truth stays Herself—and every man
That trusts Her—boldly up—
$The Veins of other Flowers
811
The Veins of other Flowers
The Scarlet Flowers are
Till Nature leisure has for Terms
As "Branch," and "Jugular."

We conjugate Her Skill
While She creates and federates
Without a syllable.
$The Way I read a Letter's—this
636
The Way I read a Letter's—this—
'Tis first—I lock the Door—
And push it with my fingers—next—
For transport it be sure—
And then I go the furthest off
To counteract a knock—
Then draw my little Letter forth
And slowly pick the lock—
Then—glancing narrow, at the Wall—
And narrow at the floor
For firm Conviction of a Mouse
Not exorcised before—
Peruse how infinite I am
To no one that You—know—
And sigh for lack of Heaven—but not
The Heaven God bestow—
$The White Heat
Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat?
Then crouch within the door --
Red -- is the Fire's common tint --
But when the vivid Ore
Has vanquished Flame's conditions,
It quivers from the Forge
Without a color, but the light
Of unanointed Blaze.
Least Village has its Blacksmith
Whose Anvil's even ring
Stands symbol for the finer Forge
That soundless tugs -- within --
Re[f]ining these impatient Ores
With Hammer, and with Blaze
Untile the Designated Light
Repudiate the Forge
$The Whole of it came not at once
762
The Whole of it came not at once-
'Twas Murder by degrees-
A Thrust-and then for Life a chance-
The Bliss to cauterize-
The Cat reprieves the Mouse
She eases from her teeth
Just long enough for Hope to tease-
Then mashes it to death-
'Tis Life's award-to die-
Contenteder if once-
Than dying half-then rallying
For consciouser Eclipse-
$The Wind begun to knead the Grass
824
[first version]
The Wind begun to knead the Grass-
As Women do a Dough-
He flung a Hand full at the Plain-
A Hand full at the Sky-
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees-
And started all abroad-
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands-
And throw away the Road-
The Wagons-quickened on the Street-
The Thunders gossiped low-
The Lightning showed a Yellow Head-
And then a livid Toe-
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests-
The Cattle flung to Barns-
Then came one drop of Giant Rain-
And then, as if the Hands
That held the Dams-had parted hold-
The Waters Wrecked the Sky-
But overlooked my Father's House-
Just Quartering a Tree-
[second version]
The Wind begun to rock the Grass
With threatening Tunes and low-
He threw a Menace at the Earth-
A Menace at the Sky.
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees-
And started all abroad
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands
And threw away the Road.
The Wagons quickened on the Streets
The Thunder hurried slow-
The Lightning showed a Yellow Beak
And then a livid Claw.
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests-
The Cattle fled to Barns-
There came one drop of Giant Rain

With threatening tunes and low,--

A menace at the sky.

And started all abroad;

And throw away the road.
The wagons quickened on the streets,
The thunder hurried slow;
The lightning showed a yellow beak,
And then a livid claw.
The birds put up the bars to nests,
The cattle fled to barns;
There came one drop of giant rain,
And then, as if the hands
That held the dams had parted hold,
The waters wrecked the sky
But overlooked my father's house,
lust quartering a tree.
$The Wind didn't come from the Orchard—today

The Wind didn't come from the Orchard—today—
Further than that—
Nor stop to play with the Hay—
Nor joggle a Hat—
He's a transitive fellow—very—
Rely on that—
If He leave a Bur at the door
We know He has climbed a Fir—
But the Fir is Where—Declare—
Were you ever there?
If He brings Odors of Clovers—
And that is His business—not Ours—
Then He has been with the Mowers—
Whetting away the Hours
To sweet pauses of Hay—
His Way—of a June Day—
If He fling Sand, and Pebble—
Little Boys Hats—and Stubble—
With an occasional Steeple—
And a hoarse "Get out of the way, I say,"
Who'd be the fool to stay?
Would you—Say—
Would you be the fool to stay?
$The wind trapped like a tired man,
The wind tapped like a tired man,
And like a host, 'Come in,'
I boldly answered; entered then
My residence within
A rapid, footless guest,
To offer whom a chair
Were as impossible as hand
A sofa to the air.
No bone had he to bind him,
His speech was like the push
Of numerous humming-birds at once
From a superior bush.
His countenance a billow,
His fingers, if he pass,
Let go a music, as of tunes
Blown tremulous in glass.
He visited, still flitting;
Then, like a timid man,
Again he tapped--'t was flurriedly--
And I became alone.
$The Winters are so short
403
The Winters are so short-
I'm hardly justified
In sending all the Birds away-
And moving into Pod-
Myself-for scarcely settled-
The Phoebes have begun-
And then-it's time to strike my Tent-
And open House-again-
It's mostly, interruptions-
My Summer-is despoiled-
Because there was a Winter-once-
And al the Cattle-starved-
And so there was a Deluge-
And swept the World away-
But Ararat's a Legend-now-
And no one credits Noah-
$The Woodpecker
His bill an auger is,
His head, a cap and frill.
He laboreth at every tree,--
A worm his utmost goal.

When they Thirst comes-
And Hybla Balms-
Dews of Thessaly, to fetch-

To clasp her soul-for all-
A prayer, that it more angel-prove-
A whiter Gift-within-

Or posture-to redeem!

Their Height in Heaven comforts not-
Their Glory-nought to me-

The Glimmering Frontier that
Skirts the Acres of Perhaps-
To Me-shows insecure-
The Wealth I had-contented me-
If 'twas a meaner size-
Then I had counted it until
It pleased my narrow Eyes-
Better than larger values-
That show however true-
This timid life of Evidence
Keeps pleading-"I don't know."

In far October Air.
$There came a Day at Summer's full

There came a Day at Summer's full,
Entirely for me-
I thought that such were for the Saints,
Where Resurrections-be-
The Sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
As if no soul the solstice passed
That maketh all things new-
The time was scarce profaned, by speech-
The symbol of a word
Was needless, as at Sacrament,
The Wardrobe-of our Lord-
Each was to each The Sealed Church,
Permitted to commune this-time-
Lest we too awkward show
At Supper of the Lamb.
The Hours slid fast-as Hours will,
Clutched tight, by greedy hands-
So faces on two Decks, look back,
Bound to opposing lands-
And so when all the time had leaked,
Without external sound
Each bound the Other's Crucifix-
We gave no other Bond-
Sufficient troth, that we shall rise-
Deposed-at length, the Grave-
To that new Marriage,
Justified-through Calvaries of Love-
$There came a Wind like a Bugle
There cam a Wind like a Bugle -
It quivered through the Grass
And a Green Chill upon the Heat
So ominous did pass
We barred the Windows and the Doors
As from an Emerald Ghost -
The Doom's electric Moccasin
The very instant passed -
On a strange Mob of panting Trees
And Fences fled away
And Rivers where the Houses ran
Those looked that lived - that Day -
The Bell within the steeple wild
The flying tidings told -
How much can come
And much can go,
And yet abide the World!

And Whatsoever Insect pass-

Proportioned to his several dearth
And her-capacity-
Her face be rounder than the Moon
And ruddier than the Gown
Or Orchis in the Pasture-
Or Rhododendron-worn-
She doth not wait for June-
Before the World be Green-
Her sturdy little Countenance
Against the Wind-be seen-
Contending with the Grass-
Near Kinsman to Herself-
For Privilege of Sod and Sun-
Sweet Litigants for Life-
And when the Hills be full-
And newer fashions blow-
Doth not retract a single spice
For pang of jealousy-
Her Public-be the Noon-
Her Providence-the Sun-
Her Progress-by the Bee-proclaimed-
In sovereign-Swerveless Tune-
The Bravest-of the Host-
Surrendering-the last-
Nor even of Defeat-aware-
What cancelled by the Frost-

There is a June when Corn is cut
And Roses in the Seed-
A Summer briefer than the first
But tenderer indeed
As should a Face supposed the Grave's
Emerge a single Noon
In the Vermilion that it wore
Affect us, and return-
Two Seasons, it is said, exist-

And this of Ours, diversified
With Prospect, and with Frost-
May not our Second with its First
So infinite compare
That We but recollect the one
The other to prefer?

There is a Languor of the Life
More imminent than Pain-
'Tis Pain's Successor-When the Soul

A Drowsiness-diffuses-

Envelops Consciousness-
As Mists-obliterate a Crag.
The Surgeon-does not blanch-at pain

But tell him that it ceased to feel-
The Creature lying there-
And he will tell you-skill is late-
A Mightier than He-
Has ministered before Him-

There is a morn by men unseen-
Whose maids upon remoter green
Keep their Seraphic May-
And all day long, with dance and game,
And gambol I may never name-
Employ their holiday.
Here to light measure, move the feet
Which walk no more the village street-
Nor by the wood are found-
Here are the birds that sought the sun
When last year's distaff idle hung
And summer's brows were bound.
Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene-
Ne'er such a ring on such a green-
Nor so serene array-
As if the stars some summer night
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite-
And revel till the day-
Like thee to dance-like thee to sing-
People upon the mystic green-
I ask, each new May Morn.
I wait thy far, fantastic bells-
Unto the different dawn!

Would drop Him—Bone by Bone.

But that's-Behind the Grave-

There is a word
Which bears a sword
Can pierce an armed man-
It hurls its barbed syllables
And is mute again-
But where it fell
The saved will tell
On patriotic day,
Some epauletted Brother
Gave his breath away.
Wherever runs the breathless sun-
Wherever roams the day-
There is its noiseless onset-
There is its victory!
Behold the keenest marksman!
The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
Is a soul "forgot!"

There is another sky,
Ever serene and fair,
And there is another sunshine,
Though it be darkness there;
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
Never mind silent fields-
Here is a little forest,
Whose leaf is ever green;
Here is a brighter garden,
Where not a frost has been;
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum:
Prithee, my brother,
Into my garden come!

There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons--
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes--
Heavenly Hurt, it gives us--
We can find no scar,
But internal difference,
Where the Meanings, are--
None may teach it--Any--
'Tis the Seal Despair--
An imperial affliction
Sent us of the air--
When it comes, the Landscape listens--
Shadows--hold their breath--
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance
On the look of Death--
$There's been a death in the opposite house
There's been a death in the opposite house
As lately as to-day.
I know it by the numb look
Such houses have alway.
The neighbors rustle in and out,
The doctor drives away.
A window opens like a pod,
Abrupt, mechanically;
Somebody flings a mattress out,--
The children hurry by;
They wonder if It died on that,--
I used to when a boy.
The minister goes stiffly in
As if the house were his,
And he owned all the mourners now,
And little boys besides;
And then the milliner, and the man
Of the appalling trade,
To take the measure of the house.
There'll be that dark parade
Of tassels and of coaches soon;
It's easy as a sign,--
The intuition of the news
In just a country town.
$There's something quieter than sleep

There's something quieter than sleep
Within this inner room!
It wears a sprig upon its breast-
And will not tell its name.
Some touch it, and some kiss it-
Some chafe its idle hand-
It has a simple gravity
I do not understand!
I would not weep if I were they-
How rude in one to sob!
Might scare the quiet fairy
Back to her native wood!
While simple-hearted neighbors
Chat of the "Early dead"-
We-prone to periphrasis
Remark that Birds have fled!
$These are the days when Birds come back
130
These are the days when Birds come back-
A very few-a Bird or two-
To take a backward look.
These are the days when skies resume
The old-old sophistries of June-
A blue and gold mistake.
Oh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee-
Almost thy plausibility
Induces my belief.
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear-
And softly thro' the altered air
Hurries a timid leaf.
Oh Sacrament of summer days,
Oh Last Communion in the Haze-
Permit a child to join.
Thy sacred emblems to partake-
They consecrated bread to take
And thine immortal wine!

Nor Cattle were-nor Soil-
But in their stead-a Sea-displayed-
And Ships-of such a size
As Crew of Mountains-could afford-
And Decks-to seat the skies-
This-too-the Showman rubbed away-
And when I looked again-
Nor Farm-nor Opal Herd-was there-
Nor Mediterranean-
$They dropped like flakes
They dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
Like petals from a rose,
When suddenly across the lune
A wind with fingers goes.
They perished in the seamless grass,--
No eye could find the place;
But God on his repealless list
Can summon every face
$They have a little Odor—that to me
785
They have a little Odor—that to me
Is metre—nay—'tis melody—
And spiciest at fading—indicate—
A Habit—of a Laureate—
$'They Have Not Chosen Me,' He Said
'They have not chosen me,' he said,
'But I have chosen them!'
Brave—Broken hearted statement—
Uttered in Bethlehem!
I could not have told it,
But since Jesus dared—
Sovereign! Know a Daisy
They dishonor shared!
$They leave us with the Infinite
350
They leave us with the Infinite.
But He-is not a man-
His fingers are the size of fists-
His fists, the size of men-
And whom he foundeth, with his Arm
As Himmaleh, shall stand-
Gibraltar's Everlasting Shoe
Poised lightly on his Hand,
So trust him, Comrade-
You for you, and I, for you and me
Eternity is ample,
And quick enough, if true.
$They put Us far apart
474
They put Us far apart-
As separate as Sea
And Her unsown Peninsula-
We signified "These see"-
They took away our Eyes-
They thwarted Us with Guns-
"I see Thee" each responded straight
Through Telegraphic Signs-
With Dungeons-They devised-
But through their thickest skill-
And their opaquest Adamant-
Our Souls saw-just as well-
They summoned Us to die-
With sweet alacrity
We stood upon our stapled feet-
Condemned-but just-to see-
Permission to recant-
Permission to forget-
We turned our backs upon the Sun
For perjury of that-
Not Either-noticed Death-
Of Paradise-aware-
Each other's Face-was all the Disc
Each other's setting-saw-
$They say that 'time assuages,
They say that 'time assuages,'--
Time never did assuage;
An actual suffering strengthens,
As sinews do, with age.
Time is a test of trouble,
But not a remedy.
If such it prove, it prove too
There was no malady.
$They Shut Me Up in Prose
They shut me up in Prose --
As when a little Girl
They put me in the Closet --
Because they liked me "still" --
Still! Could themself have peeped --
And seen my Brain -- go round --
They might as wise have lodged a Bird
For Treason -- in the Pound --
Himself has but to will
And easy as a Star
Abolish his Captivity --
And laugh -- No more have I --
$They won't frown always—some sweet Day
874
They won't frown always—some sweet Day
When I forget to tease—
They'll recollect how cold I looked
And how I just said "Please."
Then They will hasten to the Door
To call the little Girl
Who cannot thank Them for the Ice
That filled the lisping full.
$This Bauble was preferred of Bees
805
This Bauble was preferred of Bees-
By Butterflies admired
At Heavenly-Hopeless Distances-
Was justified of Bird-
Did Noon-enamel-in Herself
Was Summer to a Score
Who only knew of Universe-
It had created Her.
$This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life
858
This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life
I mention it to you,
When Sunrise through a fissure drop
The Day must follow too.
If we demur, its gaping sides
Disclose as 'twere a Tomb
Ourself am lying straight wherein
The Favorite of Doom.
When it has just contained a Life
Then, Darling, it will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turbulent it grows
I'm tempted half to stitch it up
With a remaining Breath
I should not miss in yielding, though
To Him, it would be Death-
And so I bear it big about
My Burial-before
A Life quite ready to depart
Can harass me no more-
$This Consciousness that is aware
822
This Consciousness that is aware
Of Neighbors and the Sun
Will be the one aware of Death
And that itself alone
Is traversing the interval
Experience between
And most profound experiment
Appointed unto Men-
How adequate unto itself
Its properties shall be
Itself unto itself and none
Shall make discovery.
Adventure most unto itself
The Soul condemned to be-
Attended by a single Hound
Its own identity.
$This Dust, and its Feature
936
This Dust, and its Feature-
Accredited-Today-
Will in a second Future-
Cease to identify-
This Mind, and its measure-
A too minute Area
For its enlarged inspection's
Comparison-appear-
This World, and its species
A too concluded show
For its absorbed Attention's
Remotest scrutiny-
$This heart that broke so long
145
This heart that broke so long-
These feet that never flagged-
This faith that watched for star in vain,
Give gently to the dead-
Hound cannot overtake the Hare
That fluttered panting, here-
Nor any schoolboy rob the nest
Tenderness builded there.
$This is a Blossom of the Brain
945
This is a Blossom of the Brain-
A small-italic Seed
Lodged by Design or Happening
The Spirit fructified-
Shy as the Wind of his Chambers
Swift as a Freshet's Tongue
So of the Flower of the Soul
Its process is unknown.
When it is found, a few rejoice
The Wise convey it Home
Carefully cherishing the spot
If other Flower become.
When it is lost, that Day shall be
The Funeral of God,
Upon his Breast, a closing Soul
The Flower of our Lord.
$This is my letter to the world,
This is my letter to the world,
That never wrote to me,--
The simple news that Nature told,
With tender majesty.
Her message is committed
To hands I cannot see;
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
Judge tenderly of me!
$This is the land the sunset washes,
This is the land the sunset washes,
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;
Where it rose, or whither it rushes,
These are the western mystery!
Night after night her purple traffic
Strews the landing with opal bales;
Merchantmen poise upon horizons,
Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.
$This Merit hath the worst
979
This Merit hath the worst-
It cannot be again-
When Fate hath taunted last
And thrown Her furthest Stone-
The Maimed may pause, and breathe,
And glance securely round-
The Deer attracts no further
Than it resists-the Hound-
$This Quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies
This quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies
And lads and girls;
Was laughter and ability and sighing,
And frocks and curls;
This passive place a summer's nimble mansion,
Where bloom and bees
Fulfilled their oriental circuit,
Then ceased like these.
$This that would greet-an hour ago
778
This that would greet-an hour ago-
Is quaintest Distance-now-
Had it a Guest from Paradise-
Nor glow, would it, nor bow-
Had it a notice from the Noon
Nor beam would it nor warm-
Match me the Silver Reticence-
Match me the Solid Calm-
$This was a Poet-It is That
448
This was a Poet-It is That
Distills amazing sense
From ordinary Meanings-
And Attar so immense
From the familiar species
That perished by the Door-
We wonder it was not Ourselves
Arrested it-before-
Of Pictures, the Discloser-
The Poet-it is He-
Entitles Us-by Contrast-
To ceaseless Poverty-
Of portion-so unconscious-
The Robbing-could not harm-
Himself-to Him-a Fortune-
Exterior-to Time-
$This was in the White of the Year
995
This was in the White of the Year-
That-was in the Green-
Drifts were as difficult then to think
As Daisies now to be seen-
Looking back is best that is left
Or if it be-before-
Retrospection is Prospect's half,
Sometimes, almost more.
$This World is not Conclusion
501
This World is not Conclusion.
A Species stands beyond-
Invisible, as Music-
But positive, as Sound-
It beckons, and it baffles-
Philosophy-don't know-
And through a Riddle, at the last-
Sagacity, must go-
To guess it, puzzles scholars-
To gain it, Men have borne
Contempt of Generations
And Crucifixion, shown-
Faith slips-and laughs, and rallies-
Blushes, if any see-
Plucks at a twig of Evidence-
And asks a Vane, the way-
Much Gesture, from the Pulpit-
Strong Hallelujahs roll-
Narcotics cannot still the Tooth
That nibbles at the soul-
$This-is the land-the Sunset washes
266
This-is the land-the Sunset washes-
These-are the Banks of the Yellow Sea-
Where it rose-or whither it rushes-
These-are the Western Mystery!
Night after Night
Her purple traffic
Strews the landing with Opal Bales-
Merchantmen-poise upon Horizons-
Dip-and vanish like Orioles!
$Tho' I get home how late—how late
207
Tho' I get home how late—how late—
So I get home - 'twill compensate—
Better will be the Ecstasy
That they have done expecting me—
When Night—descending—dumb—and dark—
They hear my unexpected knock—
Transporting must the moment be—
Brewed from decades of Agony!
To think just how the fire will burn—
Just how long-cheated eyes will turn—
To wonder what myself will say,
And what itself, will say to me—
Beguiles the Centuries of way!
$Tho' my destiny be Fustian
163
Tho' my destiny be Fustian-
Hers be damask fine-
Tho' she wear a silver apron-
I, a less divine-
Still, my little Gypsy being
I would far prefer,
Still, my little sunburnt bosom
To her Rosier,
For, when Frosts, their punctual fingers
On her forehead lay,
You and I, and Dr. Holland,
Bloom Eternally!
Roses of a steadfast summer
In a steadfast land,
Where no Autumn lifts her pencil-
And no Reapers stand!
$Those fair—fictitious People
499
Those fair—fictitious People—
The Women—plucked away
From our familiar Lifetime—
The Men of Ivory—
Those Boys and Girls, in Canvas—
Who stay upon the Wall
In Everlasting Keepsake—
Can Anybody tell?
We trust—in places perfecter—
Inheriting Delight
Beyond our faint Conjecture—
Our dizzy Estimate—
Remembering ourselves, we trust—
Yet Blesseder—than We—
Through Knowing—where We only hope—
Receiving—where we—pray—
Of Expectation—also—
Anticipating us
With transport, that would be a pain
Except for Holiness—
Esteeming us—as Exile—
Themself—admitted Home—
Through easy Miracle of Death—
The Way ourself, must come—
$Those who have been in the Grave the longest
922
Those who have been in the Grave the longest-
Those who begin Today-
Equally perish from our Practise-
Death is the other way-
Foot of the Bold did least attempt it-
It-is the White Exploit-
Once to achieve, annuls the power
Once to communicate-

Three times—we parted—Breath—and I—
Three times—He would not go—
But strove to stir the lifeless Fan
The Waters—strove to stay.
Three Times—the Billows tossed me up—
Then caught me—like a Ball—
Then made Blue faces in my face—
And pushed away a sail
That crawled Leagues off—I liked to see—
For thinking—while I die—
How pleasant to behold a Thing
Where Human faces—be—
The Waves grew sleepy—Breath—did not—
The Winds—like Children—lulled—
Then Sunrise kissed my Chrysalis—
And I stood up—and lived—
$Through lane it lay—through bramble
9
Through lane it lay—through bramble—
Through clearing and through wood—
Banditti often passed us
Upon the lonely road.
The wolf came peering curious—
The owl looked puzzled down—
The serpent's satin figure
Glid stealthily along—
The tempests touched our garments—
The lightning's poinards gleamed—
Fierce from the Crag above us
The hungry Vulture screamed—
The satyr's fingers beckoned—
The valley murmured "Come"—
These were the mates—
This was the road
Those children fluttered home.
$Through the Dark Sod—as Education

Swinging her Beryl Bell—
The Mold-life—all forgotten—now—
In Ecstasy—and Dell—
$Through the strait pass of suffering
792
Through the strait pass of suffering-
The Martyrs-even-trod.
Their feet-upon Temptations-
Their faces-upon God-
A stately-shriven-Company-
Convulsion-playing round-
Harmless-as streaks of Meteor-
Upon a Planet's Bond-
Their faith-the everlasting troth-
Their Expectation-fair-
The Needle-to the North Degree-
Wades-so-thro' polar Air!
$Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
Then I am ready to go!
Just a look at the horses --
Rapid! That will do!
Put me in on the firmest side,
So I shall never fall;
For we must ride to the Judgment,
And it's partly down hill.
But never I mind the bridges,
And never I mind the sea;
Held fast in everlasting race
By my own choice and thee.
Good-by to the life I used to lives,
And the world I used to know;
And kiss the hills for me, just once;
Now I am ready to go!

Till Death—is narrow Loving—

Of Finiteness—be spent—
But He whose loss procures you
Such Destitution that

Thenceforward imitate—
Until—Resemblance perfect—
Yourself, for His pursuit
Delight of Nature—abdicate—
Exhibit Love—somewhat—

By Processes of Size
For the Stupendous Vision
Of his diameters-

When Cerements let go
And Creatures clad in Miracle
Go up by Two and Two.

'Tis customary as we part
A trinket-to confer-

Presents me with a single Curl
Of her Electric Hair-
$'Tis good-the looking back on Grief

'Tis good-the looking back on Grief-
To re-endure a Day-
We thought the Mighty Funeral-
Of All Conceived Joy-
To recollect how Busy Grass
Did meddle-one by one-
Till all the Grief with Summer-waved
And none could see the stone.
And though the Woe you have Today
Be larger-As the Sea
Exceeds its Unremembered Drop-
They're Water-equally-

Continual upon me—
$'Tis not that Dying hurts us so

'Tis not that Dying hurts us so-
'Tis Living-hurts us more-
But Dying-is a different way-
A Kind behind the Door-
The Southern Custom-of the Bird-
That ere the Frosts are due-
Accepts a better Latitude-
We-are the Birds-that stay.
The Shrivers round Farmers' doors-
For whose reluctant Crumb-
We stipulate-till pitying Snows
Persuade our Feathers Home.

'Tis so appalling-it exhilarates-
So over Horror, it half Captivates-
The Soul stares after it, secure-
A Sepulchre, fears frost, no more-
To scan a Ghost, is faint-
But grappling, conquers it-
How easy, Torment, now-
Suspense kept sawing so-
The Truth, is Bald, and Cold-
But that will hold-
If any are not sure-
We show them-prayer-
But we, who know,
Stop hoping, now-
Looking at Death, is Dying-
Just let go the Breath-
And not the pillow at your Cheek
So Slumbereth-
Others, Can wrestle-
Yours, is done-
And so of Woe, bleak dreaded-come,
It sets the Fright at liberty-
And Terror's free-
Gay, Ghastly, Holiday!
$'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!

'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!
If I should fail, what poverty!
And yet, as poor as I,
Have ventured all upon a throw!
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so-
This side the Victory!
Life is but Life! And Death, but Death!
Bliss is, but Bliss, and Breath but Breath!
And if indeed I fail,
At least, to know the worst, is sweet!
Defeat means nothing but Defeat,
No drearier, can befall!
And if I gain! Oh Gun at Sea!
Oh Bells, that in the Steeples be!
At first, repeat it slow!
For Heaven is a different thing,
Conjectured, and waked sudden in-
And might extinguish me!

To fight aloud, is very brave-
But gallanter, I know
Who charge within the bosom
The Cavalry of Woe-
Who win, and nations do not see-

For such, the Angels go-

And Uniforms of Snow.

To hear an Oriole sing
May be a common thing-
Or only a divine.
It is not of the Bird
Who sings the same, unheard,
As unto Crowd-

Attireth that it hear
In Dun, or fair-
So whether it be Rune,
Or whether it be none
Is of within.

To interrupt His Yellow Plan

Caprices of the Atmosphere-
And even when the Snow
Heaves Balls of Specks, like Vicious Boy
Directly in His Eye-
Does not so much as turn His Head
Busy with Majesty-
'Tis His to stimulate the Earth-
And magnetize the Sea-
And bind Astronomy, in place,

To whom He could entrust His wavering gaze-
Until it settle broad-on Paradise-

Was Dying as He thought-or different-
Was it a pleasant Day to die-
And did the Sunshine face his way-
What was His furthest mind-Of Home-or God-
Or what the Distant say-
At news that He ceased Human Nature
Such a Day-
And Wishes-Had He Any-
Just His Sigh-Accented-

And was He Confident until
Ill fluttered out-in Everlasting Well-
And if He spoke-What name was Best-
What last

Haunted by native lands, the while-
And blue-beloved air!
This is the Sovereign Anguish!

By Decalogues-away-

To put this World down, like a Bundle-
And walk steady, away,

'Tis the Scarlet way
Trodden with straight renunciation
By the Son of God-
Later, his faint Confederates
Justify the Road-
Flavors of that old Crucifixion-
Filaments of Bloom, Pontius Pilate sowed-
Strong Clusters, from Barabbas' Tomb-
Sacrament, Saints partook before us-
Patent, every drop,
With the Brand of the Gentile Drinker
Who indorsed the Cup-

Dwelt hesitating, half of Dust,
And half of Day, the Bride.

I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step
Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare
To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down the hill
And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop - docile and omnipotent -
At its own stable door.
$Triumph—may be of several kinds

Triumph—may be of several kinds—
There's Triumph in the Room
When that Old Imperator—Death—
By Faith
$Trust in the Unexpected
555
Trust in the Unexpected-
By this-was William Kidd
Persuaded of the Buried Gold-
As One had testified-
Through this-the old Philosopher-
His Talismanic Stone
Discern&eacute;d-still withholden
To effort undivine-
'Twas this-allured Columbus-
When Genoa-withdrew
Before an Apparition
Baptized America-
The Same-afflicted Thomas-
When Deity assured
'Twas better-the perceiving not-
Provided it believed-
$Truth—is as old as God
836
Truth—is as old as God—
His Twin identity
And will endure as long as He
A Co-Eternity—
And perish on the Day
Himself is borne away
From Mansion of the Universe
A lifeless Deity.
$'Twas a long Parting-but the time
625
'Twas a long Parting-but the time
For Interview-had Come-
Before the Judgment Seat of God-
The last-and second time
These Fleshless Lovers met-
A Heaven in a Gaze-
A Heaven of Heavens-the Privilege
Of one another's Eyes-
No Lifetime-on Them-
Appareled as the new
Unborn-except They had beheld-
Born infiniter-now-
Was Bridal-e'er like This?
A Paradise-the Host-
And Cherubim-and Seraphim-
The unobtrusive Guest-
$Twas Crisis—All the length had passed
'Twas Crisis—All the length had passed—
That dull—benumbing time
There is in Fever or Event—
And now the Chance had come—
The instant holding in its claw
The privilege to live
Or warrant to report the Soul
The other side the Grave.
The Muscles grappled as with leads
That would not let the Will—
The Spirit shook the Adamant—
But could not make it feel.
The Second poised—debated—shot—
Another had begun—
And simultaneously, a Soul
Escaped the House unseen—
$'Twas just this time, last year, I died
445
'Twas just this time, last year, I died.
I know I heard the Corn,
When I was carried by the Farms-
It had the Tassels on-
I thought how yellow it would look-
When Richard went to mill-
And then, I wanted to get out,
But something held my will.
I thought just how Red-Apples wedged
The Stubble's joints between-
And the Carts stooping round the fields
To take the Pumpkins in-
I wondered which would miss me, least,
And when Thanksgiving, came,
If Father'd multiply the plates-
To make an even Sum-
And would it blur the Christmas glee
My Stocking hang too high
For any Santa Claus to reach
The Altitude of me-
But this sort, grieved myself,
And so, I thought the other way,
How just this time, some perfect year-
Themself, should come to me-
$'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch
414
'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch,
That nearer, every Day,
Kept narrowing its boiling Wheel
Until the Agony
Toyed coolly with the final inch
Of your delirious Hem-
And you dropt, lost,
When something broke-
And let you from a Dream-
As if a Goblin with a Gauge-
Kept measuring the Hours-
Until you felt your Second
Weigh, helpless, in his Paws-
And not a Sinew-stirred-could help,
And sense was setting numb-
When God-remembered-and the Fiend
Let go, then, Overcome-
As if your Sentence stood-pronounced-
And you were frozen led
From Dungeon's luxury of Doubt
To Gibbets, and the Dead-
And when the Film had stitched your eyes
A Creature gasped "Reprieve"!
Which Anguish was the utterest-then-
To perish, or to live?
$'Twas Love—not me
394
'Twas Love—not me—
Oh punish—pray—
The Real one died for Thee—
Just Him—not me—
Such Guilt—to love Thee—most!
Doom it beyond the Rest—
Forgive it—last—
'Twas base as Jesus—most!
Let Justice not mistake—
We Two—looked so alike—
Which was the Guilty Sake—
'Twas Love's—Now Strike!
$Twas such a little—little boat
107
'Twas such a little—little boat
That toddled down the bay!
'Twas such a gallant—gallant sea
That beckoned it away!
'Twas such a greedy, greedy wave
That licked it from the Coast—
Nor ever guessed the stately sails
My little craft was lost!
$'Twas the old—road—through pain
344
'Twas the old—road—through pain—
That unfrequented—one—
With many a turn—and thorn—
That stops—at Heaven—
This—was the Town—she passed—
There—where she—rested—last—
Then—stepped more fast—
The little tracks—close prest—
Then—not so swift—
Slow—slow—as feet did weary—grow—
Then—stopped—no other track!
Wait! Look! Her little Book—
The leaf—at love—turned back—
Her very Hat—
And this worn shoe just fits the track—
Herself—though—fled!
Another bed—a short one—
Women make—tonight—
In Chambers bright—
Too out of sight—though—
For our hoarse Good Night—
To touch her Head!
$'Twas warm—at first—like Us
519
'Twas warm—at first—like Us—
Until there crept upon
A Chill—like frost upon a Glass—
Till all the scene—be gone.
The Forehead copied Stone—
The Fingers grew too cold
To ache—and like a Skater's Brook—
The busy eyes—congealed—
It straightened—that was all—
It crowded Cold to Cold—
It multiplied indifference—
As Pride were all it could—
And even when with Cords—
'Twas lowered, like a Weight—
It made no Signal, nor demurred,
But dropped like Adamant.
$Twice had Summer her fair Verdure

Twice had Summer her fair Verdure
Proffered to the Plain-
Twice a Winter's silver Fracture
On the Rivers been-
Two full Autumns for the Squirrel
Bounteous prepared-
Nature, Had'st thou not a Berry
For thy wandering Bird?
$Two butterflies went out at noon
Two butterflies went out at noon
And waltzed above a stream,
Then stepped straight through the firmament
And rested on a beam;
And then together bore away
Upon a shining sea,--
Though never yet, in any port
Their coming mentioned be.
If spoken by the distant bird,
If met in ether sea
By frigate or by merchantman,
Report was not to me.
$Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
201
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar-
Until the morning sun-
When One-turned smiling to the land-
Oh God! the Other One!
The stray ships-passing-
Spied a face-
Upon the waters borne-
With eyes in death-still begging raised-
And hands-beseeching-thrown!
$Two Travellers perishing in Snow
933
Two Travellers perishing in Snow
The Forests as they froze
Together heard them strengthening
Each other with the words
That Heaven if Heaven-must contain
What Either left behind
And then the cheer too solemn grew
For language, and the wind
Long steps across the features took
That Love had touched the Morn
With reverential Hyacinth-
The taleless Days went on
Till Mystery impatient drew
And those They left behind
Led absent, were procured of Heaven
As Those first furnished, said-

Unit, like Death, for Whom?
True, like the Tomb,
Who tells no secret
Told to Him-
The Grave is strict-

Just two-the Bearer-
And the Borne-
And seat-just One-
The Living-tell-
The Dying-but a Syllable-
The Coy Dead-None-
No Chatter-here-no tea-
So Babbler, and Bohea-stay there-
But Gravity-and Expectation-and Fear-
A tremor just, that All's not sure.

How Kinsmen fell—
Brothers and Sister—who preferred the Glory—
And their young will
Bent to the Scaffold, or in Dungeons—chanted—
Till God's full time—
When they let go the ignominy—smiling—
And Shame went still—
Unto guessed Crests, my moaning fancy, leads me,
Worn fair
By Heads rejected—in the lower country—
Of honors there—
Such spirit makes her perpetual mention,
That I—grown bold—
Step martial—at my Crucifixion—
As Trumpets—rolled—
Feet, small as mine—have marched in Revolution
Firm to the Drum—
Hands—not so stout—hoisted them—in witness—
When Speech went numb—

Drilled bright—

And is held low to freezing lips-

Invests so mean a brow!
Almost a powdered Footman
Might dare to touch it now!
Wait till in Everlasting Robes
That Democrat is dressed,
Then prate about "Preferment"-
And "Station," and the rest!
Around this quiet Courtier
Obsequious Angels wait!
Full royal is his Retinue!
Full purple is his state!
A Lord, might dare to lift the Hat
To such a Modest Clay
Since that My Lord, "the Lord of Lords"
Receives unblushingly!

And then the Panels are reversed-
And we behold-no more.

But that Thyself fatigue of Us—

And blame the scanty love

We do not play on Graves-
Because there isn't Room-
Besides-it isn't even-it slants
And People come-
And put a Flower on it-
And hang their faces so-
We're fearing that their Hearts will drop-
And crush our pretty play-
And so we move as far
As Enemies-away-
Just looking round to see how far
It is-Occasionally-
$We don't cry—Tim and I

But we bolt the door tight
To prevent a friend—
Then we hide our brave face
Deep in our hand—
Not to cry—Tim and I—
We are far too grand—
Nor to dream—he and me—
Do we condescend—
We just shut our brown eye
To see to the end—
Tim—see Cottages—
But, Oh, so high!
Then—we shake—Tim and I—
And lest I—cry—
Tim—reads a little Hymn—
And we both pray—
Please, Sir, I and Tim—

But since it is playing—kill us,
And we are playing—shriek—

It is a truth—of Blood—
But we—are dying in Drama—
And Drama—is never dead—
Cautious—We jar each other—
And either—open the eyes—
Lest the Phantasm—prove the Mistake—
And the livid Surprise
Cool us to Shafts of Granite—
With just an Age—and Name—
And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian—
It's prudenter—to dream—
$We Grow Accustomed to the Dark
We grow accustomed to the Dark --
When light is put away --
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp
To witness her Goodbye --
A Moment -- We uncertain step
For newness of the night --
Then -- fit our Vision to the Dark --
And meet the Road -- erect --
And so of larger -- Darkness --
Those Evenings of the Brain --
When not a Moon disclose a sign --
Or Star -- come out -- within --
The Bravest -- grope a little --
And sometimes hit a Tree
Directly in the Forehead --
But as they learn to see --
Either the Darkness alters --
Or something in the sight
Adjusts itself to Midnight --
And Life steps almost straight.
$We learned the Whole of Love

We learned the Whole of Love-
The Alphabet-the Words-
A Chapter-then the mighty Book-
Then-Revelation closed-
But in Each Other's eyes
An Ignorance beheld-
Diviner than the Childhood's-
And each to each, a Child-
Attempted to expound
What Neither-understood-
Alas, that Wisdom is so large-
And Truth-so manifold!
$We like march, his shoes are purple,
We like March, his shoes are purple,
He is new and high;
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,
Makes he forest dry;
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,
And begets her spot.
Stands the sun so close and mighty
That our minds are hot.
News is he of all the others;
Bold it were to die
With the blue-birds buccaneering
On his British sky.

Sent various—scattered ways—
We parted as the Central Flint
Were cloven with an Adze—
Subsisting on the Light We bore
Before We felt the Dark—
A Flint unto this Day—perhaps—
But for that single Spark.

We miss Her, not because We see-
The Absence of an Eye-

And put it in the Drawer-

Like Costumes Grandsires wore.

At what o'clock to heaven-they fled-
Who saw them-Wherefore fly?

Unto the Dead
There's no Geography-
But State-Endowal-Focus-
Where-Omnipresence-fly?

We see-Comparatively-
The Thing so towering high
We could not grasp its segment
Unaided-Yesterday-
This Morning's finer Verdict-
Makes scarcely worth the toil-
A furrow-Our Cordillera-
Our Apennine-a Knoll-
Perhaps 'tis kindly-done us-
The Anguish-and the loss-
The wrenching-for His Firmament
The Thing belonged to us-
To spare these Striding Spirits
Some Morning of Chagrin-
The waking in a Gnat's-embrace-
Our Giants-further on-
$We should not mind so small a flower

We should not mind so small a flower-
Except it quiet bring
Our little garden that we lost
Back to the Lawn again.
So spicy her Carnations nod-
So drunken, reel her Bees-
So silver steal a hundred flutes
From out a hundred trees-
That whoso sees this little flower
By faith may clear behold
The Bobolinks around the throne
And Dandelions gold.
$We talked as Girls do

We talked as Girls do-
Fond, and late-
We speculated fair, on every subject, but the Grave-
Of ours, none affair-
We handled Destinies, as cool-
As we-Disposers-be-
And God, a Quiet Party
To our Authority-
But fondest, dwelt upon Ourself
As we eventual-be-
When Girls to Women, softly raised
We-occupy-Degree-
We parted with a contract
To cherish, and to write
But Heaven made both, impossible
Before another night.

Went up a year this evening!
I recollect it well!
Amid no bells nor bravoes
The bystanders will tell!
Cheerful-as to the village-
Tranquil-as to repose-
Chastened-as to the Chapel
This humble Tourist rose!
Did not talk of returning!
Alluded to no time
When, were the gales propitious-
We might look for him!
Was grateful for the Roses
In life's diverse bouquet-
Talked softly of new species
To pick another day;
Beguiling thus the wonder
The wondrous nearer drew-
Hands bustled at the moorings-
The crown respectful grew-
Ascended from our vision
To Countenances new!
A Difference-A Daisy-
Is all the rest I knew!

'Tis late your Sunrise vex their face-
And Purple Ribaldry-of Morning
Pour as blank on them
As on the Tier of Wall
The Mason builded, yesterday,
And equally as cool-
What care the Dead for Summer?

Could waste the Snow before their Gate-
And knew One Bird a Tune-
Could thrill their Mortised Ear
Of all the Birds that be-
This One-beloved of Mankind
Henceforward cherished be-
What care the Dead for Winter?
Themselves as easy freeze-
June Noon-as January Night-
As soon the South-her Breeze
Of Sycamore-or Cinnamon-
Deposit in a Stone
And put a Stone to keep it Warm-
Give Spices-unto Men-

What did They do since I saw Them?
Were They industrious?
So many questions to put Them
Have I the eagerness
That could I snatch Their Faces
That could Their lips reply
Not till the last was answered
Should They start for the Sky.
Not if Their Party were waiting,
Not if to talk with Me
Were to Them now, Homesickness
After Eternity.
Not if the Just suspect me
And offer a Reward
Would I restore my Booty
To that Bold Person, God-

But, No lid has Memory-
For frequent, all my sense obscured

As someone held a light unto
The Features so beloved--
And I arise-and in my Dream-
Do Thee distinguished Grace-
Till jealous Daylight interrupt-
And mar thy perfectness-
$What if I say I shall not wait!

What if I say I shall not wait!
What if I burst the fleshly Gate-
And pass escaped-to thee!
What if I file this Mortal-off-
See where it hurt me-That's enough-
And wade in Liberty!

Dungeons can call-and Guns implore
Unmeaning-now-to me-
As laughter-was-an hour ago-
Or Laces-or a Travelling Show-
Or who died-yesterday!

Won't they scold us—when we're homesick—
Or tell God—how cross we are—

As "a Father"—in the sky—
So if I get lost—there—ever—
Or do what the Nurse calls "die"—

What when the Eggs fly off in Music
From the Maple Keep?
What shall I do when the Skies a'chirrup
Drop a Tune on me-
When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup
What will become of me?
Oh, when the Squirrel fills His Pockets
And the Berries stare
How can I bear their jocund Faces

All day and night with bark and start—
And yet, it will not go—
Would you untie it, were you me—
Would it stop whining—if to Thee—
I sent it—even now?
It should not tease you—
By your chair—or, on the mat—
Or if it dare—to climb your dizzy knee—
Or—sometimes at your side to run—
When you were willing—

And Lily tubes-like Wells-
Bees-by the furlong-
Straits of Blue
Navies of Butterflies-sailed thro'-
And dappled Cowslip Dells-
Then I have "shares" in Primrose "Banks"-
Daffodil Dowries-spicy "Stocks"-
Dominions-broad as Dew-
Bags of Doublons-adventurous Bees
Brought me-from firmamental seas-
And Purple-from Peru-
Now-have I bought it-
"Shylock"? Say!
Sign me the Bond!
"I vow to pay
To Her-who pledges this-
One hour-of her Sovereign's face"!
Ecstatic Contract!
Niggard Grace!
My Kingdom's worth of Bliss!

$When Diamonds are a Legend
397
When Diamonds are a Legend,
And Diadems-a Tale-
I Brooch and Earrings for Myself,
Do sow, and Raise for sale-
And tho' I'm scarce accounted,
My Art, a Summer Day-had Patrons-
Once-it was a Queen-
And once-a Butterfly-
$When I count the seeds
40
When I count the seeds
That are sown beneath,
To bloom so, bye and bye-
When I con the people
Lain so low,
To be received as high-
When I believe the garden
Mortal shall not see-
Pick by faith its blossom
And avoid its Bee,
I can spare this summer, unreluctantly.
$When I have seen the Sun emerge
888
When I have seen the Sun emerge
From His amazing House-
And leave a Day at every Door
A Deed, in every place-
Without the incident of Fame
Or accident of Noise-
The Earth has seemed to me a Drum,
Pursued of little Boys
$When I hoped, I recollect
768
When I hoped, I recollect
Just the place I stood-
At a Window facing West-
Roughest Air-was good-
Not a Sleet could bite me-
Not a frost could cool-
Hope it was that kept me warm-
Not Merino shawl-
When I feared-I recollect
Just the Day it was-
Worlds were lying out to Sun-
Yet how Nature froze-
Icicles upon my soul
Prickled Blue and Cool-
Bird went praising everywhere-
Only Me-was still-
And the Day that I despaired-
This-if I forget
Nature will-that it be Night
After Sun has set-
Darkness intersect her face-
And put out her eye-
Nature hesitate-before
Memory and I-
$When I was small, a Woman died
596
When I was small, a Woman died-
Today-her Only Boy
Went up from the Potomac-
His face all Victory
To look at her-How slowly
The Seasons must have turned
Till Bullets clipt an Angle
And He passed quickly round-
If pride shall be in Paradise-
Ourself cannot decide-
Of their imperial Conduct-
No person testified-
But, proud in Apparition-
That Woman and her Boy
Pass back and forth, before my Brain
As even in the sky-
I'm confident that Bravoes-
Perpetual break abroad
For Braveries, remote as this
In Scarlet Maryland-
$When Katie walks, this simple pair accompany her side
222
When Katie walks, this simple pair accompany her side,
When Katie runs unwearied they follow on the road,
When Katie kneels, their loving hands still clasp her pious knee-
Ah! Katie! Smile at Fortune, with two so knit to thee!
$When Night is almost done
347
When Night is almost done-
And Sunrise grows so near
That we can touch the Spaces-
It's time to smooth the Hair-
And get the Dimples ready-
And wonder we could care
For that old-faded Midnight-
That frightened-but an Hour-
$When One has given up One's life
853
When One has given up One's life
The parting with the rest
Feels easy, as when Day lets go
Entirely the West
The Peaks, that lingered last
Remain in Her regret
As scarcely as the Iodine
Upon the Cataract.
$When Roses cease to bloom, Sir
32
When Roses cease to bloom, Sir,
And Violets are done-
When Bumblebees in solemn flight
Have passed beyond the Sun-
The hand that paused to gather
Upon this Summer's day
Will idle lie-in Auburn-
Then take my flowers-pray!
$When the Astronomer stops seeking
851
When the Astronomer stops seeking
For his Pleiad's Face-
When the lone British Lady
Forsakes the Arctic Race
When to his Covenant Needle
The Sailor doubting turns-
It will be amply early
To ask what treason means.
$When we stand on the tops of Things
242
When we stand on the tops of Things-
And like the Trees, look down-
The smoke all cleared away from it-
And Mirrors on the scene-
Just laying light-no soul will wink
Except it have the flaw-
The Sound ones, like the Hills-shall stand-
No Lighting, scares away-
The Perfect, nowhere be afraid-
They bear their dauntless Heads,
Where others, dare not go at Noon,
Protected by their deeds-
The Stars dare shine occasionally
Upon a spotted World-
And Suns, go surer, for their Proof,
As if an Axle, held-
$Where bells no more affright the morn
112
Where bells no more affright the morn-
Where scrabble never comes-
Where very nimble Gentlemen
Are forced to keep their rooms-
Where tired Children placid sleep
Thro' Centuries of noon
This place is Bliss-this town is Heaven-
Please, Pater, pretty soon!
"Oh could we climb where Moses stood,
And view the Landscape o'er"
Not Father's bells-nor Factories,
Could scare us any more!
$Where I have lost, I softer tread
104
Where I have lost, I softer tread-
I sow sweet flower from garden bed-
I pause above that vanished head
And mourn.
Whom I have lost, I pious guard
From accent harsh, or ruthless word-
Feeling as if their pillow heard,
Though stone!
When I have lost, you'll know by this-
A Bonnet black-A dusk surplice-
A little tremor in my voice
Like this!
Why, I have lost, the people know
Who dressed in flocks of purest snow
Went home a century ago
Next Bliss!

And then—the Wharf is still!

Where Thou art—that—is Home—
Cashmere—or Calvary—the same—

So I may Come—

Tho' Bands of Spices—row—

$Whether my bark went down at sea
52
Whether my bark went down at sea-
Whether she met with gales-
Whether to isles enchanted
She bent her docile sails-
By what mystic mooring
She is held today-
This is the errand of the eye
Out upon the Bay.
$While Asters-
331
While Asters-
On the Hill-
Their Everlasting fashions-set-
And Covenant Gentians-Frill!
$While it is alive
491
While it is alive
Until Death touches it
While it and I lap one Air
Dwell in one Blood
Under one Sacrament
Show me Division can split or pare-
Love is like Life-merely longer
Love is like Death, during the Grave
Love is the Fellow of the Resurrection
Scooping up the Dust and chanting "Live"!
$Who Court obtain within Himself
803

Sees every Man a King-
And Poverty of Monarchy
Is an interior thing-
No Man depose
Whom Fate Ordain-
And Who can add a Crown
To Him who doth continual
Conspire against His Own
$Who Giants know, with lesser Men
796
Who Giants know, with lesser Men
Are incomplete, and shy-
For Greatness, that is ill at ease
In minor Company-
A Smaller, could not be perturbed-
The Summer Gnat displays-
Unconscious that his single Fleet
Do not comprise the skies-
$Who never lost, are unprepared
73
Who never lost, are unprepared
A Coronet to find!
Who never thirsted
Flagons, and Cooling Tamarind!
Who never climbed the weary league-
Can such a foot explore
The purple territories
On Pizarro's shore?
How many Legions overcome-
The Emperor will say?
How many Colors taken
On Revolution Day?
How many Bullets bearest?
Hast Thou the Royal scar?
Angels! Write "Promoted"
On this Soldier's brow!
$Who occupies this House?
892
Who occupies this House?
A Stranger I must judge
Since No one know His Circumstance-
'Tis well the name and age
Are writ upon the Door
Or I should fear to pause
Where not so much as Honest Dog
Approach encourages.
It seems a curious Town-
Some Houses very old,
Some-newly raised this Afternoon,
Were I compelled to build
It should not be among
Inhabitants so still
But where the Birds assemble
And Boys were possible.
Before Myself was born
'Twas settled, so they say,
A Territory for the Ghosts-
And Squirrels, formerly.
Until a Pioneer, as
Settlers often do
Liking the quiet of the Place
Attracted more unto-
And from a Settlement
A Capital has grown
Distinguished for the gravity
Of every Citizen.
The Owner of this House
A Stranger He must be-
Eternity's Acquaintances
Are mostly so-to me.
$Whose are the little beds, I asked
142
Whose are the little beds, I asked
Which in the valleys lie?
Some shook their heads, and others smiled-
And no one made reply.
Perhaps they did not hear, I said,
I will inquire again-
Whose are the beds-the tiny beds
So thick upon the plain?
'Tis Daisy, in the shortest-
A little further on-
Nearest the door-to wake the Ist-
Little Leontoden.
'Tis Iris, Sir, and Aster-
Anemone, and Bell-
Bartsia, in the blanket red-
And chubby Daffodil.
Meanwhile, at many cradles
Her busy foot she plied-
Humming the quaintest lullaby
That ever rocked a child.
Hush! Epigea wakens!
The Crocus stirs her lids-
Rhodora's cheek is crimson,
She's dreaming of the woods!
Then turning from them reverent-
Their bedtime 'tis, she said-
The Bumble bees will wake them
When April woods are red.
$Whose cheek is this?
82
Whose cheek is this?
What rosy face
Has lost a blush today?
I found her-"pleiad"-in the woods
And bore her safe away.
Robins, in the tradition
Did cover such with leaves,
But which the cheek-
And which the pall
My scrutiny deceives.
$Why do I love You, Sir?
"Why do I love" You, Sir?
Because—
The Wind does not require the Grass
To answer—Wherefore when He pass
She cannot keep Her place.
Because He knows—and
Do not You—
And We know not—
Enough for Us
The Wisdom it be so—
The Lightning—never asked an Eye
Wherefore it shut—when He was by—
Because He knows it cannot speak—
And reasons not contained—
—Of Talk—
There be—preferred by Daintier Folk—
The Sunrise—Sire—compelleth Me—
Because He's Sunrise—and I see—
Therefore—Then—
I love Thee—
$Why make it doubt—it hurts it so
462
Why make it doubt—it hurts it so—
So sick—to guess—
So strong—to know—
So brave—upon its little Bed
To tell the very last They said
Unto Itself—and smile—And shake—
For that dear—distant—dangerous—Sake—
But—the Instead—the Pinching fear
That Something—it did do—or dare—
Offend the Vision—and it flee—
And They no more remember me—
Nor ever turn to tell me why—
Oh, Master, This is Misery—
$Why-do they shut Me out of Heaven?
248
Why-do they shut Me out of Heaven?
Did I sing-too loud?
But-I can say a little "Minor"
Timid as a Bird!
Wouldn't the Angels try me-
Just-once-more-
Just-see-if I troubled them-
But don't-shut the door!
Oh, if I-were the Gentleman
In the "White Robe"-
And they-were the little Hand-that knocked-
Could-I-forbid?

$Will there really be a "Morning"?
101
Will there really be a "Morning"?
Is there such a thing as "Day"?
Could I see it from the mountains
If I were as tall as they?
Has it feet like Water lilies?
Has it feathers like a Bird?
Is it brought from famous countries
Of which I have never heard?
Oh some Scholar! Oh some Sailor!
Oh some Wise Men from the skies!
Please to tell a little Pilgrim
Where the place called "Morning" lies!

$Within my Garden, rides a Bird
500
Within my Garden, rides a Bird
Upon a single Wheel-
Whose spokes a dizzy Music make
As 'twere a travelling Mill-
He never stops, but slackens
Above the Ripest Rose-
Partakes without alighting
And praises as he goes,
Till every spice is tasted-
And then his Fairy Gig
Reels in remoter atmospheres-
And I rejoin my Dog,
And He and I, perplex us
If positive, 'twere we-
Or bore the Garden in the Brain
This Curiosity-
But He, the best Logician,
Refers my clumsy eye-
To just vibrating Blossoms!
An Exquisite Reply!
$Within my reach!
90
Within my reach!
I could have touched!
I might have chanced that way!
Soft sauntered thro' the village-
Sauntered as soft away!
So unsuspected Violets
Within the meadows go-
Too late for striving fingers
That passed, an hour ago!
$Without this—there is nought

Without this—there is nought—
All other Riches be
As is the Twitter of a Bird—
Heard opposite the Sea—
I could not care—to gain
A lesser than the Whole—
For did not this include themself—
As Seams—include the Ball?
I wished a way might be
My Heart to subdivide—
'Twould magnify—the Gratitude—
And not reduce—the Gold—

You cannot put a Fire out-
A Thing that can ignite
Can go, itself, without a Fan-
Upon the slowest Night-
You cannot fold a Flood-
And put it in a Drawer-
Because the Winds would find it out-
And tell your Cedar Floor-

And fashions-intervene-
When Moon's at full-'Tis Thou-I say-

And Dollie—gone!

That night will never be—
When frightened—home to Thee I run—
To find the windows dark—
And no more Dollie—mark—

But I guess guessing hurts—

Tight fitting—Orange—Brown—
Inside a Jacket duller—
She wore when she was born—
Her Cap is small—and snug—
Constructed for the Winds—
She'd pass for Barehead—short way off—
But as She Closer stands—
So finer 'tis than Wool—
You cannot feel the Seam—
Nor is it Clasped unto of Band—
Nor held upon—of Brim—
You'll know Her—by Her Voice—

Of Mines, I little know—myself—
But just the names, of Gems—
The Colors of the Commonest—
And scarce of Diadems—

But this, must be a different Wealth—
To miss it—beggars so—
I'm sure 'tis India—all Day—
To those who look on You—
Without a stint—without a blame,
Might I—but be the Jew—
I'm sure it is Golconda—

To have a smile for Mine—each Day,
How better, than a Gem!
At least, it solaces to know
That there exists—a Gold—
Altho' I prove it, just in time
Its distance—to behold—
Its far—far Treasure to surmise—
And estimate the Pearl—
