  "poem": "A shady friend for torrid days\nIs easier to find\nThan one of higher temperature\nFor frigid hour of mind.\nThe vane a little to the east\nScares muslin souls away;\nIf broadcloth breasts are firmer\nThan those of organdy,\nWho is to blame? The weaver?\nAh! the bewildering thread!\nThe tapestries of paradise!\nSo notelessly are made!\n",
