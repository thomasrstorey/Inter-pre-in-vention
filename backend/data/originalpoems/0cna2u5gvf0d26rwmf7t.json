  "poem": "If I should die,\nAnd you should live-\nAnd time should gurgle on-\nAnd morn should beam-\nAnd noon should burn-\nAs it has usual done-\nIf Birds should build as early\nAnd Bees as bustling go-\nOne might depart at option\nFrom enterprise below!\n'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand\nWhen we with Daisies lie-\nThat Commerce will continue-\nAnd Trades as briskly fly-\nIt makes the parting tranquil\nAnd keeps the soul serene-\nThat gentlemen so sprightly\nConduct the pleasing scene!\n",
