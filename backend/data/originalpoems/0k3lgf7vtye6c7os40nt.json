  "poem": "Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth-\nWidths out of the Sun-\nAnd look-and shudder, and block your breath-\nAnd deem to be alone\nIn such a place, what horror,\nHow Goblin it would be-\nAnd fly, as 'twere pursuing you?\nThen Loneliness-looks so-\nDid you ever look in a Cannon's face-\nBetween whose Yellow eye-\nAnd yours-the Judgment intervened-\nThe Question of \"To die\"-\nExtemporizing in your ear\nAs cool as Satyr's Drums-\nIf you remember, and were saved-\nIt's liker so-it seems-\n",
