  "poem": "He fumbles at your Soul\nAs Players at the Keys\nBefore they drop full Music on-\nHe stuns you by degrees-\nPrepares your brittle Nature\nFor the Ethereal Blow\nBy fainter Hammers-further heard-\nThen nearer-Then so slow\nYour Breath has time to straighten-\nYour Brain-to bubble Cool-\nDeals-One-imperial-Thunderbolt-\nThat scalps your naked Soul-\nWhen Winds take Forests in the Paws-\nThe Universe-is still-\n",
