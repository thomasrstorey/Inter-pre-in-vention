  "poem": "In falling Timbers buried-\nThere breathed a Man-\nOutside-the spades-were plying-\nThe Lungs-within-\nCould He-know-they sought Him-\nCould They-know-He breathed-\nHorrid Sand Partition-\nNeither-could be heard-\nNever slacked the Diggers-\nBut when Spades had done-\nOh, Reward of Anguish,\nIt was dying-Then-\nMany Things-are fruitless-\n'Tis a Baffling Earth-\nBut there is no Gratitude\nLike the Grace-of Death-\n",
