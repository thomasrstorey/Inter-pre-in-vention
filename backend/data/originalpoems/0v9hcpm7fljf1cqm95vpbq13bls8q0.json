  "poem": "Of nearness to her sundered Things\nThe Soul has special times-\nWhen Dimness-looks the Oddity-\nDistinctness-easy-seems-\nThe Shapes we buried, dwell about,\nFamiliar, in the Rooms-\nUntarnished by the Sepulchre,\nThe Mouldering Playmate comes-\nIn just the Jacket that he wore-\nLong buttoned in the Mold\nSince we-old mornings, Children-played-\nDivided-by a world-\nThe Grave yields back her Robberies-\nThe Years, our pilfered Things-\nBright Knots of Apparitions\nSalute us, with their wings-\nAs we-it were-that perished-\nThemself-had just remained till we rejoin them-\nAnd 'twas they, and not ourself\nThat mourned.\n",
