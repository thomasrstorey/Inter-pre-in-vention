  "poem": "Death sets a thing significant\nThe eye had hurried by,\nExcept a perished creature\nEntreat us tenderly\nTo ponder little workmanships\nIn crayon or in wool,\nWith 'This was last her fingers did,'\nIndustrious until\nThe thimble weighed too heavy,\nThe stitches stopped themselves,\nAnd then 't was put among the dust\nUpon the closet shelves.\nA book I have, a friend gave,\nWhose pencil, here and there,\nHad notched the place that pleased him,--\nAt rest his fingers are.\nNow, when I read, I read not,\nFor interrupting tears\nObliterate the etchings\nToo costly for repairs.\n",
