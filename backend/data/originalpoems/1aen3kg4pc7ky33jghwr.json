  "poem": "It would have starved a Gnat-\nTo live so small as I-\nAnd yet I was a living Child-\nWith Food's necessity\nUpon me-like a Claw-\nI could no more remove\nThan I could coax a Leech away-\nOr make a Dragon-move-\nNot like the Gnat-had I-\nThe privilege to fly\nAnd seek a Dinner for myself-\nHow mightier He-than I-\nNor like Himself-the Art\nUpon the Window Pane\nTo gad my little Being out-\nAnd not begin-again-\n",
