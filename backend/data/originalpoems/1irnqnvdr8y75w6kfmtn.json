{"pid":"1irnqnvdr8y75w6kfmtn","title":"By The Sea","poem":"I started early, took my dog,\nAnd visited the sea;\nThe mermaids in the basement\nCame out to look at me.\nAnd frigates in the upper floor\nExtended hempen hands,\nPresuming me to be a mouse\nAground, upon the sands.\nBut no man moved me till the tide\nWent past my simple shoe,\nAnd past my apron and my belt,\nAnd past my bodice too,\nAnd made as he would eat me up\nAs wholly as a dew\nUpon a dandelion's sleeve -\nAnd then I started too.\nAnd he - he followed close behind;\nI felt his silver heel\nUpon my ankle, - then my shoes\nWould overflow with pearl.\nUntil we met the solid town,\nNo man he seemed to know;\nAnd bowing with a mighty look\nAt me, the sea withdrew.\n","children":"NULL","orig_src":"","poem_num":0,"links":[]}
