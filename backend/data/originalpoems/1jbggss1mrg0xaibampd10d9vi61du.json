  "poem": "Adrift! A little boat adrift!\nAnd night is coming down!\nWill no one guide a little boat\nUnto the nearest town?\nSo Sailors say-on yesterday-\nJust as the dusk was brown\nOne little boat gave up its strife\nAnd gurgled down and down.\nSo angels say-on yesterday-\nJust as the dawn was red\nOne little boat-o'erspent with gales-\nRetrimmed its masts-redecked its sails-\nAnd shot-exultant on!\n",
