  "poem": "The Sun and Moon must make their haste-\nThe Stars express around\nFor in the Zones of Paradise\nThe Lord alone is burned-\nHis Eye, it is the East and West-\nThe North and South when He\nDo concentrate His Countenance\nLike Glow Worms, flee away-\nOh Poor and Far-\nOh Hindred Eye\nThat hunted for the Day-\nThe Lord a Candle entertains\nEntirely for Thee-\n",
