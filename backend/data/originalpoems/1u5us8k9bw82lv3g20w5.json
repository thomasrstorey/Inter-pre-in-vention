  "poem": "It knew no Medicine-\nIt was not Sickness-then-\nNor any need of Surgery-\nAnd therefore-'twas not Pain-\nIt moved away the Cheeks-\nA Dimple at a time-\nAnd left the Profile-plainer-\nAnd in the place of Bloom\nIt left the little Tint\nThat never had a Name-\nYou've seen it on a Cast's face-\nWas Paradise-to blame-\nIf momently ajar-\nTemerity-drew near-\nAnd sickened-ever afterward\nFor Somewhat that it saw?\n",
