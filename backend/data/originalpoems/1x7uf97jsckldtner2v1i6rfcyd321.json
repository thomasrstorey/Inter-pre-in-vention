  "poem": "This is a Blossom of the Brain-\nA small-italic Seed\nLodged by Design or Happening\nThe Spirit fructified-\nShy as the Wind of his Chambers\nSwift as a Freshet's Tongue\nSo of the Flower of the Soul\nIts process is unknown.\nWhen it is found, a few rejoice\nThe Wise convey it Home\nCarefully cherishing the spot\nIf other Flower become.\nWhen it is lost, that Day shall be\nThe Funeral of God,\nUpon his Breast, a closing Soul\nThe Flower of our Lord.\n",
