  "poem": "I had a guinea golden-\nI lost it in the sand-\nAnd tho' the sum was simple\nAnd pounds were in the land-\nStill, had it such a value\nUnto my frugal eye-\nThat when I could not find it-\nI sat me down to sigh.\nI had a crimson Robin-\nWho sang full many a day\nBut when the woods were painted,\nHe, too, did fly away-\nTime brought me other Robins-\nTheir ballads were the same-\nStill, for my missing Troubador\nI kept the \"house at hame.\"\nI had a star in heaven-\nOne \"Pleiad\" was its name-\nAnd when I was not heeding,\nIt wandered from the same.\nAnd tho' the skies are crowded-\nAnd all the night ashine-\nI do not care about it-\nSince none of them are mine.\nMy story has a moral-\nI have a missing friend-\n\"Pleiad\" its name, and Robin,\nAnd guinea in the sand.\nAnd when this mournful ditty\nAccompanied with tear-\nShall meet the eye of traitor\nIn country far from here-\nGrant that repentance solemn\nMay seize upon his mind-\nAnd he no consolation\nBeneath the sun may find.\n",
