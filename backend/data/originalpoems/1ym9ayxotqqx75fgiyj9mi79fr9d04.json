  "poem": "My first well Day—since many ill—\nI asked to go abroad,\nAnd take the Sunshine in my hands,\nAnd see the things in Pod—\nA 'blossom just when I went in\nTo take my Chance with pain—\nUncertain if myself, or He,\nShould prove the strongest One.\nThe Summer deepened, while we strove—\nShe put some flowers away—\nAnd Redder cheeked Ones—in their stead—\nA fond—illusive way—\nTo cheat Herself, it seemed she tried—\nAs if before a child\nTo fade—Tomorrow—Rainbows held\nThe Sepulchre, could hide.\nShe\nShe\nShe\nAnd\ndealt a fashion to the Nut—\ntied the Hoods to Seeds—\ndropped bright scraps of Tint, about—\nleft Brazilian Threads\nOn every shoulder that she met—\nThen both her Hands of Haze\nPut up—to hide her parting Grace\nFrom our unfitted eyes.\nMy loss, by sickness—Was it Loss?\nOr that Ethereal Gain\nOne earns by measuring the Grave—\nThen—measuring the Sun—\n",
