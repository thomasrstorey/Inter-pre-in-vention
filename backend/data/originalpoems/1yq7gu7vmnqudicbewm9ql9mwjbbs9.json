  "poem": "Distrustful of the Gentian-\nAnd just to turn away,\nThe fluttering of her fringes\nChild my perfidy-\nWeary for my-----\nI will singing go-\nI shall not feel the sleet-then-\nI shall not fear the snow.\nFlees so the phantom meadow\nBefore the breathless Bee-\nSo bubble brooks in deserts\nOn Ears that dying lie-\nBurn so the Evening Spires\nTo Eyes that Closing go-\nHangs so distant Heaven-\nTo a hand below.\n",
