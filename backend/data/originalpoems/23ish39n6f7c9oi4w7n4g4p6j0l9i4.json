  "poem": "There came a Day at Summer's full,\nEntirely for me-\nI thought that such were for the Saints,\nWhere Resurrections-be-\nThe Sun, as common, went abroad,\nThe flowers, accustomed, blew,\nAs if no soul the solstice passed\nThat maketh all things new-\nThe time was scarce profaned, by speech-\nThe symbol of a word\nWas needless, as at Sacrament,\nThe Wardrobe-of our Lord-\nEach was to each The Sealed Church,\nPermitted to commune this-time-\nLest we too awkward show\nAt Supper of the Lamb.\nThe Hours slid fast-as Hours will,\nClutched tight, by greedy hands-\nSo faces on two Decks, look back,\nBound to opposing lands-\nAnd so when all the time had leaked,\nWithout external sound\nEach bound the Other's Crucifix-\nWe gave no other Bond-\nSufficient troth, that we shall rise-\nDeposed-at length, the Grave-\nTo that new Marriage,\nJustified-through Calvaries of Love-\n",
