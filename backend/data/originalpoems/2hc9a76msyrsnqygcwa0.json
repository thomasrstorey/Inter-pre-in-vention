  "poem": "A light exists in spring\nNot present on the year\nAt any other period.\nWhen March is scarcely here\nA color stands abroad\nOn solitary hills\nThat science cannot overtake,\nBut human naturefeels.\nIt waits upon the lawn;\nIt shows the furthest tree\nUpon the furthest slope we know;\nIt almost speaks to me.\nThen, as horizons step,\nOr noons report away,\nWithout the formula of sound,\nIt passes, and we stay:\nA quality of loss\nAffecting our content,\nAs trade had suddenly encroached\nUpon a sacrament.\n",
