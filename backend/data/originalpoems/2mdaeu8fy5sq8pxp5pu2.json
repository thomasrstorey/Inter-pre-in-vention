  "poem": "I bring an unaccustomed wine\nTo lips long parching\nNext to mine,\nAnd summon them to drink;\nCrackling with fever, they Essay,\nI turn my brimming eyes away,\nAnd come next hour to look.\nThe hands still hug the tardy glass-\nThe lips I would have cooled, alas-\nAre so superfluous Cold-\nI would as soon attempt to warm\nThe bosoms where the frost has lain\nAges beneath the mould-\nSome other thirsty there may be\nTo whom this would have pointed me\nHad it remained to speak-\nAnd so I always bear the cup\nIf, haply, mine may be the drop\nSome pilgrim thirst to slake-\nIf, haply, any say to me\n\"Unto the little, unto me,\"\nWhen I at last awake.\n",
