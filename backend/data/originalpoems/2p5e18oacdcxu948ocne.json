  "poem": "The Grass so little has to do –\nA Sphere of simple Green –\nWith only Butterflies to brood\nAnd Bees to entertain –\nAnd stir all day to pretty Tunes\nThe Breezes fetch along –\nAnd hold the Sunshine in its lap\nAnd bow to everything –\nAnd thread the Dews, all night, like Pearls –\nAnd make itself so fine\nA Duchess were too common\nFor such a noticing –\nAnd even when it dies – to pass\nIn Odors so divine –\nLike Lowly spices, lain to sleep –\nOr Spikenards, perishing –\nAnd then, in Sovereign Barns to dwell –\nAnd dream the Days away,\nThe Grass so little has to do\nI wish I were a Hay –\n",
