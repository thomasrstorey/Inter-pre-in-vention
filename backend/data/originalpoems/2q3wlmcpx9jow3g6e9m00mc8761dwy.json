  "poem": "The Beggar Lad-dies early-\nIt's Somewhat in the Cold-\nAnd Somewhat in the Trudging feet-\nAnd haply, in the World-\nThe Cruel-smiling-bowing World-\nThat took its Cambric Way-\nNor heard the timid cry for \"Bread\"-\n\"Sweet Lady-Charity\"-\nAmong Redeemed Children\nIf Trudging feet may stand\nThe Barefoot time forgotten-so-\nThe Sleet-the bitter Wind-\nThe Childish Hands that teased for Pence\nLifted adoring-them-\nTo Him whom never Ragged-Coat\nDid supplicate in vain-\n",
