Look! Her little Book—\nThe leaf—at love—turned back—\nHer very Hat—\nAnd this worn shoe just fits the track—\nHerself—though—fled!\nAnother bed—a short one—\nWomen make—tonight—\nIn Chambers bright—\nToo out of sight—though—\nFor our hoarse Good Night—\nTo touch her Head!\n","children":"NULL","orig_src":"","poem_num":344,"links":[]}
