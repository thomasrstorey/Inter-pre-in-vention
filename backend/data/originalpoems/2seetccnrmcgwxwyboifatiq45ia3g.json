  "poem": "Further in Summer than the Birds\nPathetic from the Grass\nA minor Nation celebrates\nIts unobtrusive Mass.\nNo Ordinance be seen\nSo gradual the Grace\nA pensive Custom it becomes\nEnlarging Loneliness.\nAntiquest felt at Noon\nWhen August burning low\nArise this spectral Canticle\nRepose to typify\nRemit as yet no Grace\nNo Furrow on the Glow\nYet a Druidic Difference\nEnhances Nature now\n",
