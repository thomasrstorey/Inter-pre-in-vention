  "poem": "Nature the gentlest mother is,\nImpatient of no child,\nThe feeblest of the waywardest.\nHer admonition mild\nIn forest and the hill\nBy traveller be heard,\nRestraining rampant squirrel\nOr too impetuous bird.\nHow fair her conversation\nA summer afternoon,\nHer household her assembly;\nAnd when the sun go down,\nHer voice among the aisles\nIncite the timid prayer\nOf the minutest cricket,\nThe most unworthy flower.\nWhen all the children sleep,\nShe turns as long away\nAs will suffice tolight her lamps,\nThen bending from the sky\nWith infinite affection\nAn infiniter care,\nHer golden finger on her lip,\nWills silence everywhere.\n",
