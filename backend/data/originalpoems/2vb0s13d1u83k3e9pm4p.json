  "poem": "A drop fell on the apple tree,\nAnother on the roof;\nA half a dozen kissed the eaves,\nAnd made the gables laugh.\nA few went out to help the brook,\nThat went to help the sea.\nMyself conjectured, Were they pearls,\nWhat necklaces could be!\nThe\nThe\nThe\nThe\ndust replaced in hoisted roads,\nbirds jocoser sung;\nsunshine threw his hat away,\norchards spangles hung.\nThe breezes brought dejected lutes,\nAnd bathed them in the glee;\nThe East put out a single flag,\nAnd signed the fete away.\n",
