  "poem": "Because I could not stop for Death--\nHe kindly stopped for me--\nThe Carriage held but just Ourselves--\nAnd Immortality.\nWe slowly drove--He knew no haste\nAnd I had put away\nMy labor and my leisure too,\nFor His Civility--\nWe passed the School, where Children strove\nAt Recess--in the Ring--\nWe passed the Fields of Gazing Grain--\nWe passed the Setting Sun--\nOr rather--He passed us--\nThe Dews drew quivering and chill--\nFor only Gossamer, my Gown--\nMy Tippet--only Tulle--\nWe paused before a House that seemed\nA Swelling of the Ground--\nThe Roof was scarcely visible--\nThe Cornice--in the Ground--\nSince then--'tis Centuries--and yet\nFeels shorter than the Day\nI first surmised the Horses' Heads\nWere toward Eternity--\n",
