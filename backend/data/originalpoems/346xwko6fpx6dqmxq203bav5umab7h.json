  "poem": "One dignity delays for all-\nOne mitred Afternoon-\nNone can avoid this purple-\nNone evade this Crown!\nCoach, it insures, and footmen-\nChamber, and state, and throng-\nBells, also, in the village\nAs we ride grand along!\nWhat dignified Attendants!\nWhat service when we pause!\nHow loyally at parting\nTheir hundred hats they raise!\nHer pomp surpassing ermine\nWhen simple You, and I,\nPresent our meek escutheon\nAnd claim the rank to die!\n",
