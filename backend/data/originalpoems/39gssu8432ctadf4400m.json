  "poem": "Bring me the sunset in a cup,\nReckon the morning's flagons up\nAnd say how many Dew,\nTell me how far the morning leaps-\nTell me what time the weaver sleeps\nWho spun the breadth of blue!\nWrite me how many notes there be\nIn the new Robin's ecstasy\nAmong astonished boughs-\nHow many trips the Tortoise makes-\nHow many cups the Bee partakes,\nThe Debauchee of Dews!\nAlso, who laid the Rainbow's piers,\nAlso, who leads the docile spheres\nBy withes of supple blue?\nWhose fingers string the stalactite-\nWho counts the wampum of the night\nTo see that none is due?\nWho built this little Alban House\nAnd shut the windows down so close\nMy spirit cannot see?\nWho'll let me out some gala day\nWith implements to fly away,\nPassing Pomposity?\n",
