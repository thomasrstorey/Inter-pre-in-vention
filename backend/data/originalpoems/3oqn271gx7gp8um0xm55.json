  "poem": "Three times—we parted—Breath—and I—\nThree times—He would not go—\nBut strove to stir the lifeless Fan\nThe Waters—strove to stay.\nThree Times—the Billows tossed me up—\nThen caught me—like a Ball—\nThen made Blue faces in my face—\nAnd pushed away a sail\nThat crawled Leagues off—I liked to see—\nFor thinking—while I die—\nHow pleasant to behold a Thing\nWhere Human faces—be—\nThe Waves grew sleepy—Breath—did not—\nThe Winds—like Children—lulled—\nThen Sunrise kissed my Chrysalis—\nAnd I stood up—and lived—\n",
