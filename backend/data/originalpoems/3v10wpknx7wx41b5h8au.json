My Dim Companion!\nWhy, God, would be content\nWith but a fraction of the Life-\nPoured thee, without a stint-\nThe whole of me-forever-\nWhat more the Woman can,\nSay quick, that I may dower thee\nWith last Delight I own!\nIt cannot be my Spirit-\nFor that was thine, before-\nI ceded all of Dust I knew-\nWhat Opulence the more\nHad I-a freckled Maiden,\nWhose farthest of Degree,\nWas-that she might-\nSome distant Heaven,\nDwell timidly, with thee!\nSift her, from Brow to Barefoot!\nStrain till your last Surmise-\nDrop, like a Tapestry, away,\nBefore the Fire's Eyes-\nWinnow her finest fondness-\nBut hallow just the snow\nIntact, in Everlasting flake-\nOh, Caviler, for you!\n","children":"NULL","orig_src":"","poem_num":275,"links":[]}
