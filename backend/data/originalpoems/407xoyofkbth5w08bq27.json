{"pid":"407xoyofkbth5w08bq27","title":"First Robin","poem":"I dreaded that first robin so,\nBut he is mastered now,\nAnd I'm accustomed to him grown,--\nHe hurts a little, though.\nI thought if I could only live\nTill that first shout got by,\nNot all pianos in the woods\nHad power to mangle me.\nI dared not meet the daffodils,\nFor fear their yellow gown\nWould pierce me with a fashion\nSo foreign to my own.\nI wished the grass would hurry,\nSo when 't was time to see,\nHe'd be too tall, the tallest one\nCould stretch to look at me.\nI could not bear the bees should come,\nI wished they'd stay away\nIn those dim countries where they go:\nWhat word had they for me?\nThey're here, though; not a creature failed,\nNo blossom stayed away\nIn gentle deference to me,\nThe Queen of Calvary.\nEach one salutes me as he goes,\nAnd I my childish plumes\nLift, in bereaved acknowledgment\nOf their unthinking drums.\n","children":"NULL","orig_src":"","poem_num":0,"links":[]}
