  "poem": "A Solemn thing within the Soul\nTo feel itself get ripe-\nAnd golden hang-while farther up-\nThe Maker's Ladders stop-\nAnd in the Orchard far below-\nYou hear a Being-drop-\nA Wonderful-to feel the Sun\nStill toiling at the Cheek\nYou thought was finished-\nCool of eye, and critical of Work-\nHe shifts the stem-a little-\nTo give your Core-a look-\nBut solemnest-to know\nYour chance in Harvest moves\nA little nearer-Every Sun\nThe Single-to some lives.\n",
