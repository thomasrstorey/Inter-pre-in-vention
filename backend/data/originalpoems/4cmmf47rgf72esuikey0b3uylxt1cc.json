  "poem": "After great pain, a formal feeling comes --\nThe Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs\nThe stiff Heart questions, was it He, that bore,\nAnd Yesterday, or Centuries before?\nThe Feet, mechanical, go round --\nOf Ground, or Air, or Ought --\nA Wooden way\nRegardless grown,\nA Quartz contentment, like a stone --\nThis is the Hour of Lead --\nRemembered, if outlived,\nAs Freezing persons, recollect the Snow --\nFirst -- Chill -- then Stupor -- then the letting go --\n",
