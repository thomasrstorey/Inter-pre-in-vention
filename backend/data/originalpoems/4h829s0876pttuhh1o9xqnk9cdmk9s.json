  "poem": "I cross till I am weary\nA Mountain-in my mind-\nMore Mountains-then a Sea-\nMore Seas-And then\nA Desert-find-\nAnd My Horizon blocks\nWith steady-drifting-Grains\nOf unconjectured quantity-\nAs Asiatic Rains-\nNor this-defeat my Pace-\nIt hinder from the West\nBut as an Enemy's Salute\nOne hurrying to Rest-\nWhat merit had the Goal-\nExcept there intervene\nFaint Doubt-and far Competitor-\nTo jeopardize the Gain?\nAt last-the Grace in sight-\nI shout unto my feet-\nI offer them the Whole of Heaven\nThe instant that we meet-\nThey strive-and yet delay-\nThey perish-Do we die-\nOr is this Death's Experiment-\nReversed-in Victory?\n",
