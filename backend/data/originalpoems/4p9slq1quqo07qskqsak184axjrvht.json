  "poem": "To learn the Transport by the Pain\nAs Blind Men learn the sun!\nTo die of thirst-suspecting\nThat Brooks in Meadows run!\nTo stay the homesick-homesick feet\nUpon a foreign shore-\nHaunted by native lands, the while-\nAnd blue-beloved air!\nThis is the Sovereign Anguish!\nThis-the signal woe!\nThese are the patient \"Laureates\"\nWhose voices-trained-below-\nAscend in ceaseless Carol-\nInaudible, indeed,\nTo us-the duller scholars\nOf the Mysterious Bard!\n",
