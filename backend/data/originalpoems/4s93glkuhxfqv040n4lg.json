  "poem": "I’ll tell you how the sun rose, -\nA ribbon at a time.\nThe steeples swam in amethyst,\nThe news like squirrels ran.\nThe hills untied their bonnets,\nThe bobolinks begun.\nThen I said softly to myself,\n\"That must have been the sun!\"\nBut how he set, I know not.\nThere seemed a purple stile.\nWhich little yellow boys and girls\nWere climbing all the while\nTill when they reached the other side,\nA dominie in gray\nPut gently up the evening bars,\nAnd led the flock away.\n",
