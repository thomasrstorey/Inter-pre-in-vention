  "poem": "In Ebon Box, when years have flown\nTo reverently peer,\nWiping away the velvet dust\nSummers have sprinkled there!\nTo hold a letter to the light-\nGrown Tawny now, with time-\nTo con the faded syllables\nThat quickened us like Wine!\nPerhaps a Flower's shrivelled check\nAmong its stores to find-\nPlucked far away, some morning-\nBy gallant-mouldering hand!\nA curl, perhaps, from foreheads\nOur Constancy forgot-\nPerhaps, an Antique trinket-\nIn vanished fashions set!\nAnd then to lay them quiet back-\nAnd go about its care-\nAs if the little Ebon Box\nWere none of our affair!\n",
