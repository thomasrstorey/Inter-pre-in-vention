  "poem": "Sweet—You forgot—but I remembered\nEvery time—for Two—\nSo that the Sum be never hindered\nThrough Decay of You—\nSay if I erred? Accuse my Farthings—\nBlame the little Hand\nHappy it be for You—a Beggar's—\nSeeking More—to spend—\nJust to be Rich—to waste my Guineas\nOn so Best a Heart—\nJust to be Poor—for Barefoot Vision\nYou—Sweet—Shut me out—\n",
