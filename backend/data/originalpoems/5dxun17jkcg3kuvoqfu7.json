  "poem": "She lay as if at play\nHer life had leaped away-\nIntending to return-\nBut not so soon-\nHer merry Arms, half dropt-\nAs if for lull of sport-\nAn instant had forgot-\nThe Trick to start-\nHer dancing Eyes-ajar-\nAs if their Owner were\nStill sparkling through\nFor fun-at you-\nHer Morning at the door-\nDevising, I am sure-\nTo force her sleep-\nSo light-so deep-\n",
