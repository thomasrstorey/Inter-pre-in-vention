  "poem": "As imperceptibly as Grief\nThe Summer lapsed away-\nToo imperceptible at last\nTo seem like Perfidy-\nA Quietness distilled\nAs Twilight long begun,\nOr Nature spending with herself\nSequestered Afternoon-\nThe Dusk drew earlier in-\nThe Morning foreign shone-\nA courteous, yet harrowing Grace,\nAs Guest, that would be gone-\nAnd thus, without a Wing\nOr service of a Keel\nOur Summer made her light escape\nInto the Beautiful.\n",
