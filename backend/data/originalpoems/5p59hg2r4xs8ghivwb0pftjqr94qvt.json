  "poem": "Read—Sweet—how others—strove—\nTill we—are stouter—\nWhat they—renounced—\nTill we—are less afraid—\nHow many times they—bore the faithful witness—\nTill we—are helped—\nAs if a Kingdom—cared!\nRead then—of faith—\nThat shone above the fagot—\nClear strains of Hymn\nThe River could not drown—\nBrave names of Men—\nAnd Celestial Women—\nPassed out—of Record\nInto—Renown!\n",
