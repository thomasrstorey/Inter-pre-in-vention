  "poem": "Nature, the gentlest mother,\nImpatient of no child,\nThe feeblest or the waywardest,\nHer admonition mild\nIn forest and the hill\nBy traveller is heard,\nRestraining rampant squirrel\nOr too impetuous bird.\nHow fair her conversation,\nA summer afternoon,--\nHer household, her assembly;\nAnd when the sun goes down\nHer voice among the aisles\nIncites the timid prayer\nOf the minutest cricket,\nThe most unworthy flower.\nWhen all the children sleep\nShe turns as long away\nAs will suffice to light her lamps;\nThen, bending from the sky\nWith infinite affection\nAnd infiniter care,\nHer golden finger on her lip,\nWills silence everywhere.\n",
