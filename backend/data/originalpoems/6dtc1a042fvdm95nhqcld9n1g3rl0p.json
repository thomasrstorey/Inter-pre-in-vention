  "poem": "I think the longest Hour of all\nIs when the Cars have come-\nAnd we are waiting for the Coach-\nIt seems as though the Time\nIndignant-that the Joy was come-\nDid block the Gilded Hands-\nAnd would not let the Seconds by-\nBut slowest instant-ends-\nThe Pendulum begins to count-\nLike little Scholars-loud-\nThe steps grow thicker-in the Hall-\nThe Heart begins to crowd-\nThen I-my timid service done-\nTho' service 'twas, of Love-\nTake up my little Violin-\nAnd further North-remove.\n",
