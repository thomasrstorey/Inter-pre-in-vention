  "poem": "\"Arcturus\" is his other name—\nI'd rather call him \"Star.\"\nIt's very mean of Science\nTo go and interfere!\nI slew a worm the other day—\nA \"Savant\" passing by\nMurmured \"Resurgam\"—\"Centipede\"!\n\"Oh Lord—how frail are we\"!\nI pull a flower from the woods—\nA monster with a glass\nComputes the stamens in a breath—\nAnd has her in a \"class\"!\nWhereas I took the Butterfly\nAforetime in my hat—\nHe sits erect in \"Cabinets\"—\nThe Clover bells forgot.\nWhat once was \"Heaven\"\nIs \"Zenith\" now—\nWhere I proposed to go\nWhen Time's brief masquerade was done\nIs mapped and charted too.\nWhat if the poles should frisk about\nAnd stand upon their heads!\nI hope I'm ready for \"the worst\"—\nWhatever prank betides!\nPerhaps the \"Kingdom of Heaven's\" changed—\nI hope the \"Children\" there Won't be \"new fashioned\" when I come—\nAnd laugh at me—and stare—\nI hope the Father in the skies\nWill lift his little girl—\nOld fashioned—naught—everything—\nOver the stile of \"Pearl.\"\n",
