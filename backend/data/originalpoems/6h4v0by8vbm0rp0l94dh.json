I've no one else to tell-\nAnd so I trouble thee.\nI am the one forgot thee so-\nDost thou remember me?\nNor, for myself, I came so far-\nThat were the little load-\nI brought thee the imperial Heart\nI had not strength to hold-\nThe Heart I carried in my own-\nTill mine too heavy grew-\nYet-strangest-heavier since it went-\nIs it too large for you?\n",
