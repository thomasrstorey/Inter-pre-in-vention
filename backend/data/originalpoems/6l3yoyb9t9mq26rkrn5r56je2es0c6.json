  "poem": "The face I carry with me—last—\nWhen I go out of Time—\nTo take my Rank—by—in the West—\nThat face—will just be thine—\nI'll hand it to the Angel—\nThat—Sir—was my Degree—\nIn Kingdoms—you have heard the Raised—\nRefer to—possibly.\nHe'll take it—scan it—step aside—\nReturn—with such a crown\nAs Gabriel—never capered at—\nAnd beg me put it on—\nAnd then—he'll turn me round and round—\nTo an admiring sky—\nAs one that bore her Master's name—\nSufficient Royalty!\n",
