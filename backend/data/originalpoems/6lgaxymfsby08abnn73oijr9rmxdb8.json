  "poem": "The Months have ends—the Years—a knot—\nNo Power can untie\nTo stretch a little further\nA Skein of Misery—\nThe Earth lays back these tired lives\nIn her mysterious Drawers—\nToo tenderly, that any doubt\nAn ultimate Repose—\nThe manner of the Children—\nWho weary of the Day—\nThemself—the noisy Plaything\nThey cannot put away—\n",
