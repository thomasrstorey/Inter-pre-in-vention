  "poem": "I tried to think a lonelier Thing\nThan any I had seen-\nSome Polar Expiation-An Omen in the Bone\nOf Death's tremendous nearness-\nI probed Retrieverless things\nMy Duplicate-to borrow-\nA Haggard Comfort springs\nFrom the belief that Somewhere-\nWithin the Clutch of Thought-\nThere dwells one other Creature\nOf Heavenly Love-forgot-\nI plucked at our Partition\nAs One should pry the Walls-\nBetween Himself-and Horror's Twin-\nWithin Opposing Cells-\nI almost strove to clasp his Hand,\nSuch Luxury-it grew-\nThat as Myself-could pity Him-\nPerhaps he-pitied me-\n",
