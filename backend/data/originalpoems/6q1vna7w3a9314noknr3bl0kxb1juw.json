  "poem": "The Rose did caper on her cheek-\nHer Bodice rose and fell-\nHer pretty speech-like drunken men-\nDid stagger pitiful-\nHer fingers fumbled at her work-\nHer needle would not go-\nWhat ailed so smart a little Maid-\nIt puzzled me to know-\nTill opposite-I spied a cheek\nThat bore another Rose-\nJust opposite-Another speech\nThat like the Drunkard goes-\nA Vest that like her Bodice, danced-\nTo the immortal tune-\nTill those two troubled-little Clocks\nTicked softly into one.\n",
