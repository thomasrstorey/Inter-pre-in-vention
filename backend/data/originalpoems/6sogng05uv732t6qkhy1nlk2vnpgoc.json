  "poem": "The Tint I cannot take—is best—\nThe Color too remote\nThat I could show it in Bazaar—\nA Guinea at a sight—\nThe fine—impalpable Array—\nThat swaggers on the eye\nLike Cleopatra's Company—\nRepeated—in the sky—\nThe Moments of Dominion\nThat happen on the Soul\nAnd leave it with a Discontent\nToo exquisite—to tell—\nThe eager look—on Landscapes—\nAs if they just repressed\nSome Secret—that was pushing\nLike Chariots—in the Vest—\nThe Pleading of the Summer—\nThat other Prank—of Snow—\nThat Cushions Mystery with Tulle,\nFor fear the Squirrels—know.\nTheir Graspless manners—mock us—\nUntil the Cheated Eye\nShuts arrogantly—in the Grave—\nAnother way—to see—\n",
