  "poem": "Before you thought of spring,\nExcept as a surmise,\nYou see, God bless his suddenness,\nA fellow in the skies\nOf independent hues,\nA little weather-worn,\nInspiriting habiliments\nOf indigo and brown.\nWith specimens of song,\nAs if for you to choose,\nDiscretion in the interval,\nWith gay delays he goes\nTo some superior tree\nWithout a single leaf,\nAnd shouts for joy to nobody\nBut his seraphic self!\n",
