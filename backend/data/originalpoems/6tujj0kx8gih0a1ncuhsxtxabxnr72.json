  "poem": "I think the Hemlock likes to stand\nUpon a Marge of Snow-\nIt suits his own Austerity-\nAnd satisfies an awe\nThat men, must slake in Wilderness-\nAnd in the Desert-cloy-\nAn instinct for the Hoar, the Bald-\nLapland's-necessity-\nThe Hemlock's nature thrives-on cold-\nThe Gnash of Northern winds\nIs sweetest nutriment-to him-\nHis best Norwegian Wines-\nTo satin Races-he is nought-\nBut Children on the Don,\nBeneath his Tabernacles, play,\nAnd Dnieper Wrestlers, run.\n",
