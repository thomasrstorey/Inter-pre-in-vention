  "poem": "Struck, was I, not yet by Lightning-\nLightning-lets away\nPower to perceive His Process\nWith Vitality.\nMaimed-was I-yet not by Venture-\nStone of stolid Boy-\nNor a Sportsman's Peradventure-\nWho mine Enemy?\nRobbed-was I-intact to Bandit-\nAll my Mansion torn-\nSun-withdrawn to Recognition-\nFurthest shining-done-\nYet was not the foe-of any-\nNot the smallest Bird\nIn the nearest Orchard dwelling\nBe of Me-afraid.\nMost-I love the Cause that slew Me.\nOften as I die\nIts beloved Recognition\nHolds a Sun on Me-\nBest-at Setting-as is Nature's-\nNeither witnessed Rise\nTill the infinite Aurora\nIn the other's eyes.\n",
