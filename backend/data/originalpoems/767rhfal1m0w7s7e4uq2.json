  "poem": "A Murmur in the Trees-to note-\nNot loud enough-for Wind-\nA Star-not far enough to seek-\nNor near enough-to find-\nA long-long Yellow-on the Lawn-\nA Hubbub-as of feet-\nNot audible-as Ours-to Us-\nBut dapperer-More Sweet-\nA Hurrying Home of little Men\nTo Houses unperceived-\nAll this-and more-if I should tell-\nWould never be believed-\nOf Robins in the Trundle bed\nHow many I espy\nWhose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings-\nAlthough I heard them try-\nBut then I promised ne'er to tell-\nHow could I break My Word?\nSo go your Way-and I'll go Mine-\nNo fear you'll miss the Road.\n",
