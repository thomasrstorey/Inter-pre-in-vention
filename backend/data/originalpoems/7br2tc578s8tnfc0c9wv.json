  "poem": "Two butterflies went out at noon\nAnd waltzed above a stream,\nThen stepped straight through the firmament\nAnd rested on a beam;\nAnd then together bore away\nUpon a shining sea,--\nThough never yet, in any port\nTheir coming mentioned be.\nIf spoken by the distant bird,\nIf met in ether sea\nBy frigate or by merchantman,\nReport was not to me.\n",
