  "poem": "Love—is that later Thing than Death—\nMore previous—than Life—\nConfirms it at its entrance—And\nUsurps it—of itself—\nTastes Death—the first—to hand the sting\nThe Second—to its friend—\nDisarms the little interval—\nDeposits Him with God—\nThen hovers—an inferior Guard—\nLest this Beloved Charge\nNeed—once in an Eternity—\nA smaller than the Large—\n",
