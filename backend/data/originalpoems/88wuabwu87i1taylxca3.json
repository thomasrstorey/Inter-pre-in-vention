  "poem": "'Twas warm—at first—like Us—\nUntil there crept upon\nA Chill—like frost upon a Glass—\nTill all the scene—be gone.\nThe Forehead copied Stone—\nThe Fingers grew too cold\nTo ache—and like a Skater's Brook—\nThe busy eyes—congealed—\nIt straightened—that was all—\nIt crowded Cold to Cold—\nIt multiplied indifference—\nAs Pride were all it could—\nAnd even when with Cords—\n'Twas lowered, like a Weight—\nIt made no Signal, nor demurred,\nBut dropped like Adamant.\n",
