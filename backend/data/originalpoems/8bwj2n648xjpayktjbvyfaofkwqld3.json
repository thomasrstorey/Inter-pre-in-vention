  "poem": "The Trees like Tassels—hit—and swung—\nThere seemed to rise a Tune\nFrom Miniature Creatures\nAccompanying the Sun—\nFar Psalteries of Summer—\nEnamoring the Ear\nThey never yet did satisfy—\nRemotest—when most fair\nThe Sun shone whole at intervals—\nThen Half—then utter hid—\nAs if Himself were optional\nAnd had Estates of Cloud\nSufficient to enfold Him\nEternally from view—\nExcept it were a whim of His\nTo let the Orchards grow—\nA Bird sat careless on the fence—\nOne gossipped in the Lane\nOn silver matters charmed a Snake\nJust winding round a Stone—\nBright Flowers slit a Calyx\nAnd soared upon a Stem\nLike Hindered Flags—Sweet hoisted—\nWith Spices—in the Hem—\n'Twas more—I cannot mention—\nHow mean—to those that see—\nVandyke's Delineation\nOf Nature's—Summer Day!\n",
