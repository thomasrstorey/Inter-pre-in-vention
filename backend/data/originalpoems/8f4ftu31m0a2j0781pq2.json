  "poem": "A narrow fellow in the grass\nOccasionally rides;\nYou may have met him,--did you not,\nHis notice sudden is.\nThe grass divides as with a comb,\nA spotted shaft is seen;\nAnd then it closes at your feet\nAnd opens further on.\nHe likes a boggy acre,\nA floor too cool for corn.\nYet when a child, and barefoot,\nI more than once, at morn,\nHave passed, I thought, a whip-lash\nUnbraiding in the sun,--\nWhen, stooping to secure it,\nIt wrinkled, and was gone.\nSeveral of nature's people\nI know, and they know me;\nI feel for them a transport\nOf cordiality;\nBut never met this fellow,\nAttended or alone,\nWithout a tighter breathing,\nAnd zero at the bone.\n",
