  "poem": "Tho' my destiny be Fustian-\nHers be damask fine-\nTho' she wear a silver apron-\nI, a less divine-\nStill, my little Gypsy being\nI would far prefer,\nStill, my little sunburnt bosom\nTo her Rosier,\nFor, when Frosts, their punctual fingers\nOn her forehead lay,\nYou and I, and Dr. Holland,\nBloom Eternally!\nRoses of a steadfast summer\nIn a steadfast land,\nWhere no Autumn lifts her pencil-\nAnd no Reapers stand!\n",
