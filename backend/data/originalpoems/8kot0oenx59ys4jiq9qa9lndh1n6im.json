  "poem": "The Moon was but a Chin of Gold\nA Night or two ago-\nAnd now she turns Her perfect Face\nUpon the World below-\nHer Forehead is of Amplest Blonde-\nHer Cheek-a Beryl hewn-\nHer Eye unto the Summer Dew\nThe likest I have known-\nHer Lips of Amber never part-\nBut what must be the smile\nUpon Her Friend she could confer\nWere such Her Silver Will-\nAnd what a privilege to be\nBut the remotest Star-\nFor Certainty She take Her Way\nBeside Your Palace Door-\nHer Bonnet is the Firmament-\nThe Universe-Her Shoe-\nThe Stars-the Trinkets at Her Belt-\nHer Dimities-of Blue-\n",
