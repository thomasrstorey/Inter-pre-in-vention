  "poem": "I live with Him—I see His face—\nI go no more away\nFor Visitor—or Sundown—\nDeath's single privacy\nThe Only One—forestalling Mine—\nAnd that—by Right that He\nPresents a Claim invisible—\nNo wedlock—granted Me—\nI live with Him—I hear His Voice—\nI stand alive—Today—\nTo witness to the Certainty\nOf Immortality—\nTaught Me—by Time—the lower Way—\nConviction—Every day—\nThat Life like This—is stopless—\nBe Judgment—what it may—\n",
