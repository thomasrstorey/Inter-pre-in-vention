  "poem": "The Sun kept stooping—stooping—low!\nThe Hills to meet him rose!\nOn his side, what Transaction!\nOn their side, what Repose!\nDeeper and deeper grew the stain\nUpon the window pane—\nThicker and thicker stood the feet\nUntil the Tyrian\nWas crowded dense with Armies—\nSo gay, so Brigadier—\nThat I felt martial stirrings\nWho once the Cockade wore—\nCharged from my chimney corner—\nBut Nobody was there!\n",
