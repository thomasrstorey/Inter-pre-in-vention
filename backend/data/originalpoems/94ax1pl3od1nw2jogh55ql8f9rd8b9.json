  "poem": "I can't tell you—but you feel it—\nNor can you tell me—\nSaints, with ravished slate and pencil\nSolve our April Day!\nSweeter than a vanished frolic\nFrom a vanished green!\nSwifter than the hoofs of Horsemen\nRound a Ledge of dream!\nModest, let us walk among it\nWith our faces veiled—\nAs they say polite Archangels\nDo in meeting God!\nNot for me—to prate about it!\nNot for you—to say\nTo some fashionable Lady\n\"Charming April Day\"!\nRather—Heaven's \"Peter Parley\"!\nBy which Children slow\nTo sublimer Recitation\nAre prepared to go!\n",
