  "poem": "Ourselves were wed one summer—dear—\nYour Vision—was in June—\nAnd when Your little Lifetime failed,\nI wearied—too—of mine—\nAnd overtaken in the Dark—\nWhere You had put me down—\nBy Some one carrying a Light—\nI—too—received the Sign.\n'Tis true—Our Futures different lay—\nYour Cottage—faced the sun—\nWhile Oceans—and the North must be—\nOn every side of mine\n'Tis true, Your Garden led the Bloom,\nFor mine—in Frosts—was sown—\nAnd yet, one Summer, we were Queens—\nBut You—were crowned in June—\n",
