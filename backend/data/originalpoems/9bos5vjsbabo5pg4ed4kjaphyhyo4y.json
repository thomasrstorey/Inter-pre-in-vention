  "poem": "I dreaded that first Robin, so,\nBut He is mastered, now,\nI'm accustomed to Him grown,\nHe hurts a little, though-\nI thought If I could only live\nTill that first Shout got by-\nNot all Pianos in the Woods\nHad power to mangle me-\nI dared not meet the Daffodils-\nFor fear their Yellow Gown\nWould pierce me with a fashion\nSo foreign to my own-\nI wished the Grass would hurry-\nSo-when 'twas time to see-\nHe'd be too tall, the tallest one\nCould stretch-to look at me-\nI could not bear the Bees should come,\nI wished they'd stay away\nIn those dim countries where they go,\nWhat word had they, for me?\nThey're here, though; not a creature failed-\nNo Blossom stayed away\nIn gentle deference to me-\nThe Queen of Calvary-\nEach one salutes me, as he goes,\nAnd I, my childish Plumes,\nLift, in bereaved acknowledgment\nOf their unthinking Drums-\n",
