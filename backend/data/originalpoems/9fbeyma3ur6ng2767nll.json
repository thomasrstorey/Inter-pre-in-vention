  "poem": "More Life—went out—when He went\nThan Ordinary Breath—\nLit with a finer Phosphor—\nRequiring in the Quench—\nA Power of Renowned Cold,\nThe Climate of the Grave\nA Temperature just adequate\nSo Anthracite, to live—\nFor some—an Ampler Zero—\nA Frost more needle keen\nIs necessary, to reduce\nThe Ethiop within.\nOthers—extinguish easier—\nA Gnat's minutest Fan\nSufficient to obliterate\nA Tract of Citizen—\nWhose Peat lift—amply vivid—\nIgnores the solemn News\nThat Popocatapel exists—\nOr Etna's Scarlets, Choose—\n",
