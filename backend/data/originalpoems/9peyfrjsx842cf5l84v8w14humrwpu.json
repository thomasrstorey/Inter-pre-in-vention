  "poem": "I'll clutch—and clutch—\nNext—One—Might be the golden touch—\nCould take it—\nDiamonds—Wait—\nI'm diving—just a little late—\nBut stars—go slow—for night—\nI'll string you—in fine Necklace—\nTiaras—make—of some—\nWear you on Hem—\nLoop up a Countess—with you—\nMake—a Diadem—and mend my old One—\nCount—Hoard—then lose—\nAnd doubt that you are mine—\nTo have the joy of feeling it—again—\nI'll show you at the Court—\nBear you—for Ornament\nWhere Women breathe—\nThat every sigh—may lift you\nJust as high—as I—\nAnd—when I die—\nIn meek array—display you—\nStill to show—how rich I go—\nLest Skies impeach a wealth so wonderful—\nAnd banish me—\n",
