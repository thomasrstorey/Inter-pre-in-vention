  "poem": "The wind tapped like a tired man,\nAnd like a host, 'Come in,'\nI boldly answered; entered then\nMy residence within\nA rapid, footless guest,\nTo offer whom a chair\nWere as impossible as hand\nA sofa to the air.\nNo bone had he to bind him,\nHis speech was like the push\nOf numerous humming-birds at once\nFrom a superior bush.\nHis countenance a billow,\nHis fingers, if he pass,\nLet go a music, as of tunes\nBlown tremulous in glass.\nHe visited, still flitting;\nThen, like a timid man,\nAgain he tapped--'t was flurriedly--\nAnd I became alone.\n",
