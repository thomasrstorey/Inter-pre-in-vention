  "poem": "Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat?\nThen crouch within the door --\nRed -- is the Fire's common tint --\nBut when the vivid Ore\nHas vanquished Flame's conditions,\nIt quivers from the Forge\nWithout a color, but the light\nOf unanointed Blaze.\nLeast Village has its Blacksmith\nWhose Anvil's even ring\nStands symbol for the finer Forge\nThat soundless tugs -- within --\nRe[f]ining these impatient Ores\nWith Hammer, and with Blaze\nUntile the Designated Light\nRepudiate the Forge\n",
