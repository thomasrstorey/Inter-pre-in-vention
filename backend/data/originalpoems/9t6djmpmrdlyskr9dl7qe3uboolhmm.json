  "poem": "\"Heaven\" has different Signs—to me—\nSometimes, I think that Noon\nIs but a symbol of the Place—\nAnd when again, at Dawn,\nA mighty look runs round the World\nAnd settles in the Hills—\nAn Awe if it should be like that\nUpon the Ignorance steals—\nThe Orchard, when the Sun is on—\nThe Triumph of the Birds\nWhen they together Victory make—\nSome Carnivals of Clouds—\nThe Rapture of a finished Day—\nReturning to the West—\nAll these—remind us of the place\nThat Men call \"paradise\"—\nItself be fairer—we suppose—\nBut how Ourself, shall be\nAdorned, for a Superior Grace—\nNot yet, our eyes can see—\n",
