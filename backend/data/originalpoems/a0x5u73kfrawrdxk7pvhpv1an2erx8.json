  "poem": "'Tis good-the looking back on Grief-\nTo re-endure a Day-\nWe thought the Mighty Funeral-\nOf All Conceived Joy-\nTo recollect how Busy Grass\nDid meddle-one by one-\nTill all the Grief with Summer-waved\nAnd none could see the stone.\nAnd though the Woe you have Today\nBe larger-As the Sea\nExceeds its Unremembered Drop-\nThey're Water-equally-\n",
