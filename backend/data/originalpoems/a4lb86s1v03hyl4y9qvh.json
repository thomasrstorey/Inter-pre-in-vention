  "poem": "Flowers—Well—if anybody\nCan the ecstasy define—\nHalf a transport—half a trouble—\nWith which flowers humble men:\nAnybody find the fountain\nFrom which floods so contra flow—\nI will give him all the Daisies\nWhich upon the hillside blow.\nToo much pathos in their faces\nFor a simple breast like mine—\nButterflies from St. Domingo\nCruising round the purple line—\nHave a system of aesthetics—\nFar superior to mine.\n",
