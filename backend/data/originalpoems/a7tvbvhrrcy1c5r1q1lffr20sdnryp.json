  "poem": "I started Early - Took my Dog -\nAnd visited the Sea -\nThe Mermaids in the Basement\nCame out to look at me -\nAnd Frigates - in the Upper Floor\nExtended Hempen Hands -\nPresuming Me to be a Mouse -\nAground - upon the Sands -\nBut no Man moved Me - till the Tide\nWent past my simple Shoe -\nAnd past my Apron - and my Belt\nAnd past my Bodice - too -\nAnd made as He would eat me up -\nAs wholly as a Dew\nUpon a Dandelion's Sleeve -\nAnd then - I started - too -\nAnd He - He followed - close behind -\nI felt His Silver Heel\nUpon my Ankle - Then my Shoes\nWould overflow with Pearl -\nUntil We met the Solid Town -\nNo One He seemed to know -\nAnd bowing - with a Mighty look -\nAt me - The Sea withdrew -\n",
