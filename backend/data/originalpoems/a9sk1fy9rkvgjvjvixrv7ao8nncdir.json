  "poem": "It troubled me as once I was-\nFor I was once a Child-\nConcluding how an Atom-fell-\nAnd yet the Heavens-held-\nThe Heavens weighed the most-by far-\nYet Blue-and solid-stood-\nWithout a Bolt-that I could prove-\nWould Giants-understand?\nLife set me larger-problems-\nSome I shall keep-to solve\nTill Algebra is easier-\nOr simpler proved-above-\nThen-too-be comprehended-\nWhat sorer-puzzled me-\nWhy Heaven did not break away-\nAnd tumble-Blue-on me-\n",
