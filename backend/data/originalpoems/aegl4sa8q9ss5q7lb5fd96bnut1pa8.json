  "poem": "A bird came down the walk:\nHe did not know I saw;\nHe bit an angle-worm in halves\nAnd ate the fellow, raw.\nAnd then he drank a dew\nFrom a convenient grass,\nAnd the hopped sideways to the wall\nTo let a beetle pass.\nHe glanced with rapid eyes\nThat hurried all abroad, -\nThey looked like frightened beads, I thought\nHe stirred his velvet head.\nLike one in danger; cautious,\nI offered him a crumb,\nAnd he unrolled his feathers\nAnd rolled him softer home\nThen oars divide the ocean,\nToo silver for a seam,\nOr butterflies, off banks of noon,\nLeap, plashless, as they swim.\n",
