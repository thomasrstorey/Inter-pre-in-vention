  "poem": "Delight is as the flight-\nOr in the Ratio of it,\nAs the Schools would say-\nThe Rainbow's way-\nA Skein\nFlung colored, after Rain,\nWould suit as bright,\nExcept that flight\nWere Aliment-\n\"If it would last\"\nI asked the East,\nWhen that Bent Stripe\nStruck up my childish\nFirmament-\nAnd I, for glee,\nTook Rainbows, as the common way,\nAnd empty Skies\nThe Eccentricity-\nAnd so with Lives-\nAnd so with Butterflies-\nSeen magic-through the fright\nThat they will cheat the sight-\nAnd Dower latitudes far on-\nSome sudden morn-\nOur portion-in the fashion-\nDone-\n",
