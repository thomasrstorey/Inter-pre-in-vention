  "poem": "He parts Himself—like Leaves—\nAnd then—He closes up—\nThen stands upon the Bonnet\nOf Any Buttercup—\nAnd then He runs against\nAnd oversets a Rose—\nAnd then does Nothing—\nThen away upon a Jib—He goes—\nAnd dangles like a Mote\nSuspended in the Noon—\nUncertain—to return Below—\nOr settle in the Moon—\nWhat come of Him—at Night—\nThe privilege to say\nBe limited by Ignorance—\nWhat come of Him—That Day—\nThe Frost—possess the World—\nIn Cabinets—be shown—\nA Sepulchre of quaintest Floss—\nAn Abbey—a Cocoon—\n",
