  "poem": "A clock stopped -- not the mantel's\nGeneva's farthest skill\nCan't put the puppet bowing\nThat just now dangled still.\nAn awe came on the trinket!\nThe figures hunched with pain,\nThen quivered out of decimals\nInto degreeless noon.\nIt will not stir for doctors,\nThis pendulum of snow;\nThe shopman importunes it,\nWhile cool, concernless No\nNods from the gilded pointers,\nNods from seconds slim,\nDecades of arrogance between\nThe dial life and him.\n",
