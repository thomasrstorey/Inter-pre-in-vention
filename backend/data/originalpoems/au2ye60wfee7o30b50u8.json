  "poem": "A something in a summer's Day\nAs slow her flambeaux burn away\nWhich solemnizes me.\nA something in a summer's noon-\nA depth-an Azure-a perfume-\nTranscending ecstasy.\nAnd still within a summer's night\nA something so transporting bright\nI clap my hands to see-\nThen veil my too inspecting face\nLets such a subtle-shimmering grace\nFlutter too far for me-\nThe wizard fingers never rest-\nThe purple brook within the breast\nStill chafes it narrow bed-\nStill rears the East her amber Flag-\nGuides still the sun along the Crag\nHis Caravan of Red-\nSo looking on-the night-the morn\nConclude the wonder gay-\nAnd I meet, coming thro' the dews\nAnother summer's Day!\n",
