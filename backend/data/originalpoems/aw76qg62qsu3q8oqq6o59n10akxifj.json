  "poem": "Some, too fragile for winter winds\nThe thoughtful grave encloses-\nTenderly tucking them in from frost\nBefore their feet are cold.\nNever the treasures in her nest\nThe cautious grave exposes,\nBuilding where schoolboy dare not look,\nAnd sportsman is not bold.\nThis covert have all the children\nEarly aged, and often cold,\nSparrow, unnoticed by the Father-\nLambs for whom time had not a fold.\n",
