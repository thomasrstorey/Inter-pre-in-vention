  "poem": "If you were coming in the fall,\nI'd brush the summer by\nWith half a smile and half a spum,\nAs housewives do a fly.\nIf I could see you in a year,\nI'd wind the months in balls,\nAnd put them each in separate drawers,\nUntil their time befalls.\nIf only centuries delayed,\nI'd count them on my hand,\nSubtracting till my fingers dropped\nInto Van Diemen's land.\nIf certain, when this life was out,\nThat yours and mine should be,\nI'd toss it yonder like a rind,\nAnd taste eternity.\nBut now, all ignorant of the length\nOf time's uncertain wing,\nIt goads me, like the goblin bee,\nThat will not state its sting.\n",
