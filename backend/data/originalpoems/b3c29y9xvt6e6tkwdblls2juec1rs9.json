  "poem": "I see thee better—in the Dark—\nI do not need a Light—\nThe Love of Thee—a Prism be—\nExcelling Violet—\nI see thee better for the Years\nThat hunch themselves between—\nThe Miner's Lamp—sufficient be—\nTo nullify the Mine—\nAnd in the Grave—I see Thee best—\nIts little Panels be\nAglow—All ruddy—with the Light\nI held so high, for Thee—\nWhat need of Day—\nTo Those whose Dark—hath so—surpassing Sun—\nIt deem it be—Continually—\nAt the Meridian?\n",
