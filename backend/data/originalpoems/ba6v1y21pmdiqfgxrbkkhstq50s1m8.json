  "poem": "I rose—because He sank—\nI thought it would be opposite—\nBut when his power dropped—\nMy Soul grew straight.\nI cheered my fainting Prince—\nI sang firm—even—Chants—\nI helped his Film—with Hymn—\nAnd when the Dews drew off\nThat held his Forehead stiff—\nI met him—\nBalm to Balm—\nI told him Best—must pass\nThrough this low Arch of Flesh—\nNo Casque so brave\nIt spurn the Grave—\nI told him Worlds I knew\nWhere Emperors grew—\nWho recollected us\nIf we were true—\nAnd so with Thews of Hymn—\nAnd Sinew from within—\nAnd ways I knew not that I knew—till then—\nI lifted Him—\n",
