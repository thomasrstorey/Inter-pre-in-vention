  "poem": "If anybody's friend be dead\nIt's sharpest of the theme\nThe thinking how they walked alive-\nAt such and such a time-\nTheir costume, of a Sunday,\nSome manner of the Hair-\nA prank nobody knew but them\nLost, in the Sepulchre-\nHow warm, they were, on such a day,\nYou almost feel the date-\nSo short way off it seems-\nAnd now-they're Centuries from that-\nHow pleased they were, at what you said-\nYou try to touch the smile\nAnd dip your fingers in the frost-\nWhen was it-Can you tell-\nYou asked the Company to tea-\nAcquaintance-just a few-\nAnd chatted close with this Grand Thing\nThat don't remember you-\nPast Bows, and Invitations-\nPast Interview, and Vow-\nPast what Ourself can estimate-\nThat-makes the Quick of Woe!\n",
