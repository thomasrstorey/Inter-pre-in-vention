Dying in the night!\nWon't somebody bring the light\nSo I can see which way to go\nInto the everlasting snow?\nAnd \"Jesus\"! Where is Jesus gone?\nThey said that Jesus-always came-\nPerhaps he doesn't know the House-\nThis way, Jesus, Let him pass!\nSomebody run to the great gate\nAnd see if Dollie's coming! Wait!\nI hear her feet upon the stair!\nDeath won't hurt-now Dollie's here!\n","children":"NULL","orig_src":"","poem_num":158,"links":[]}
