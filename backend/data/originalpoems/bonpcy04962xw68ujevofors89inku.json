  "poem": "He touched me, so I live to know\nThat such a day, permitted so,\nI groped upon his breast-\nIt was a boundless place to me\nAnd silenced, as the awful sea\nPuts minor streams to rest.\nAnd now, I'm different from before,\nAs if I breathed superior air-\nOr brushed a Royal Gown-\nMy feet, too, that had wandered so-\nMy Gypsy face-transfigured now-\nTo tenderer Renown-\nInto this Port, if I might come,\nRebecca, to Jerusalem,\nWould not so ravished turn-\nNor Persian, baffled at her shrine\nLift such a Crucifixial sign\nTo her imperial Sun.\n",
