  "poem": "I have never seen \"Volcanoes\"-\nBut, when Travellers tell\nHow those old-phlegmatic mountains\nUsually so still-\nBear within-appalling Ordnance,\nFire, and smoke, and gun,\nTaking Villages for breakfast,\nAnd appalling Men-\nIf the stillness is Volcanic\nIn the human face\nWhen upon a pain Titanic\nFeatures keep their place-\nIf at length the smouldering anguish\nWill not overcome-\nAnd the palpitating Vineyard\nIn the dust, be thrown?\nIf some loving Antiquary,\nOn Resumption Morn,\nWill not cry with joy \"Pompeii\"!\nTo the Hills return!\n",
