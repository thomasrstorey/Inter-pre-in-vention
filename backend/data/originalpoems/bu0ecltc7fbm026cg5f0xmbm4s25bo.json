  "poem": "Four Trees—upon a solitary Acre—\nWithout Design\nOr Order, or Apparent Action—\nMaintain—\nThe Sun—upon a Morning meets them—\nThe Wind—\nNo nearer Neighbor—have they—\nBut God—\nThe Acre gives them—Place—\nThey—Him—Attention of Passer by—\nOf Shadow, or of Squirrel, haply—\nOr Boy—\nWhat Deed is Theirs unto the General Nature—\nWhat Plan\nThey severally—retard—or further—\nUnknown—\n",
