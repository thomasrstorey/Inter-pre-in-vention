  "poem": "Each life converges to some centre\nExpressed or still;\nExists in every human nature\nA goal,\nAdmitted scarcely to itself, it may be,\nToo fair\nFor credibility's temerity\nTo dare.\nAdored with caution, as a brittle heaven,\nTo reach\nWere hopeless as the rainbow's raiment\nTo touch,\nYet persevered toward, surer for the distance;\nHow high\nUnto the saints' slow diligence\nThe sky!\nUngained, it may be, by a life's low venture,\nBut then,\nEternity enables the endeavoring\nAgain.\n",
