  "poem": "After great pain, a formal feeling comes--\nThe Nerves sit ceremonious, like Toombs--\nThe stiff Heart questions was it He, that bore,\nAnd Yesterday, or Centuries before?\nThe Feet, mechanical, go round--\nOf Ground, or Air, or Ought--\nA Wooden way\nRegardless grown,\nA Quartz contentment, like a stone--\nThis is the Hour of Lead--\nRemembered, if outlived,\nAs Freezing persons recollect the Snow--\nFirst--Chill--then Stupor--then the letting go--\n",
