  "poem": "Heart, not so heavy as mine\nWending late home-\nAs it passed my window\nWhistled itself a tune-\nA careless snatch-a ballad-A ditty of the street-\nYet to my irritated Ear\nAn Anodyne so sweet-\nIt was as if a Bobolink\nSauntering this way\nCarolled, and paused, and carolled-\nThen bubbled slow away!\nIt was as if a chirping brook\nUpon a dusty way-\nSet bleeding feet to minuets\nWithout the knowing why!\nTomorrow, night will come again-\nPerhaps, weary and sore-\nAh Bugle! By my window\nI pray you pass once more.\n",
