  "poem": "The first Day's Night had come-\nAnd grateful that a thing\nSo terrible-had been endured-\nI told my Soul to sing-\nShe said her Strings were snapt-\nHer Bow-to Atoms blown-\nAnd so to mend her-gave me work\nUntil another Morn-\nAnd then-a Day as huge\nAs Yesterdays in pairs,\nUnrolled its horror in my face-\nUntil it blocked my eyes-\nMy Brain-begun to laugh-\nI mumbled-like a fool-\nAnd tho' 'tis Years ago-that Day-\nMy Brain keeps giggling-still.\nAnd Something's odd-within-\nThat person that I was-\nAnd this One-do not feel the same-\nCould it be Madness-this?\n",
