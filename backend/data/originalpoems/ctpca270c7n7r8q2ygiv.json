  "poem": "I got so I could take his name-\nWithout-Tremendous gain-\nThat Stop-sensation-on my Soul-\nAnd Thunder-in the Room-\nI got so I could walk across\nThat Angle in the floor,\nWhere he turned so, and I turned-how-\nAnd all our Sinew tore-\nI got so I could stir the Box-\nIn which his letters grew\nWithout that forcing, in my breath-\nAs Staples-driven through-\nCould dimly recollect a Grace-\nI think, they call it \"God\"-\nRenowned to ease Extremity-\nWhen Formula, had failed-\nAnd shape my Hands-\nPetition's way,\nTho' ignorant of a word\nThat Ordination-utters-\nMy Business, with the Cloud,\nIf any Power behind it, be,\nNot subject to Despair-\nIt care, in some remoter way,\nFor so minute affair\nAs Misery-\nItself, too vast, for interrupting-more-\n",
