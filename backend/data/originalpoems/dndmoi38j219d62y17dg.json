  "poem": "Fitter to see Him, I may be\nFor the long Hindrance-Grace-to Me-\nWith Summers, and with Winters, grow,\nSome passing Year-A trait bestow\nTo make Me fairest of the Earth-\nThe Waiting-then-will seem so worth\nI shall impute with half a pain\nThe blame that I was chosen-then-\nTime to anticipate His Gaze-\nIt's first-Delight-and then-Surprise-\nThe turning o'er and o'er my face\nFor Evidence it be the Grace-\nHe left behind One Day-So less\nHe seek Conviction, That-be This-\nI only must not grow so new\nThat He'll mistake-and ask for me\nOf me-when first unto the Door\nI go-to Elsewhere go no more-\nI only must not change so fair\nHe'll sigh-\"The Other-She-is Where?\"\nThe Love, tho', will array me right\nI shall be perfect-in His sight-\nIf He perceive the other Truth-\nUpon an Excellenter Youth-\nHow sweet I shall not lack in Vain-\nBut gain-thro' loss-Through Grief-obtain-\nThe Beauty that reward Him best-\nThe Beauty of Demand-at Rest-\n",
