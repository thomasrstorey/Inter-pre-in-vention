  "poem": "I had been hungry all the years-\nMy noon had come, to dine-\nI, trembling, drew the table near\nAnd touched the curious wine.\n'T was this on tables I had seen\nWhen turning, hungry, lone,\nI looked in windows, for the wealth\nI could not hope to own.\nI did not know the ample bread,\n'T was so unlike the crumb\nThe birds and I had often shared\nIn Nature's dining-room.\nThe plenty hurt me, 't was so new,--\nMyself felt ill and odd,\nAs berry of a mountain bush\nTransplanted to the road.\nNor was I hungry; so I found\nThat hunger was a way\nOf persons outside windows,\nThe entering takes away.\n",
