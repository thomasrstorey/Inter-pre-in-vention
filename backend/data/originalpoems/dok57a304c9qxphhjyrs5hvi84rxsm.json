  "poem": "'Twas just this time, last year, I died.\nI know I heard the Corn,\nWhen I was carried by the Farms-\nIt had the Tassels on-\nI thought how yellow it would look-\nWhen Richard went to mill-\nAnd then, I wanted to get out,\nBut something held my will.\nI thought just how Red-Apples wedged\nThe Stubble's joints between-\nAnd the Carts stooping round the fields\nTo take the Pumpkins in-\nI wondered which would miss me, least,\nAnd when Thanksgiving, came,\nIf Father'd multiply the plates-\nTo make an even Sum-\nAnd would it blur the Christmas glee\nMy Stocking hang too high\nFor any Santa Claus to reach\nThe Altitude of me-\nBut this sort, grieved myself,\nAnd so, I thought the other way,\nHow just this time, some perfect year-\nThemself, should come to me-\n",
