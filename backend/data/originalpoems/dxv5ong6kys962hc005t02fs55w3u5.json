  "poem": "Musicians wrestle everywhere-\nAll day-among the crowded air\nI hear the silver strife-\nAnd-walking-long before the morn-\nSuch transport breaks upon the town\nI think it that \"New Life\"!\nIf is not Bird-it has no nest-\nNor \"Band\"-in brass and scarlet-drest-\nNor Tamborin-nor Man-\nIt is not Hymn from pulpit read-\nThe \"Morning Stars\" the Treble led\nOn Time's first Afternoon!\nSome-say-it is \"the Spheres\"-at play!\nSome say that bright Majority\nOf vanished Dames-and Men!\nSome-think it service in the place\nWhere we-with late-celestial face-\nPlease God-shall Ascertain!\n",
