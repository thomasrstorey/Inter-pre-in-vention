  "poem": "I cannot live with You--\nIt would be Life--\nAnd Life is over there--\nBehind the Shelf\nThe Sexton keeps the Key to--\nPutting up\nOur Life--His Porcelain--\nLike a Cup--\nDiscarded of the Housewife--\nQuaint--or Broke--\nA newer Sevres pleases--\nOld Ones crack--\nI could not die--with You--\nFor One must wait\nTo shut the Other's Gaze down--\nYou--could not--\nAnd I--could I stand by\nAnd see You--freeze--\nWithout my Right of Frost--\nDeath's privilege?\nNor could I rise--with You--\nBecause Your Face\nWould put out Jesus'--\nThat New Grace\nGlow plain--and foreign\nOn my homesick Eye--\nExcept that You than He\nShone closer by--\nThey'd judge Us--How--\nFor You--served Heaven--You know,\nOr sought to--\nI could not--\nBecause You saturated Sight--\nAnd I had no more Eyes\nFor sordid excellence\nAs Paradise\nAnd were You lost, I would be--\nThough My Name\nRang loudest\nOn the Heavenly fame--\nAnd were You--saved--\nAnd I--condemned to be\nWhere You were not--\nThat self--were Hell to Me--\nSo We must meet apart--\nYou there--I--here--\nWith just the Door ajar\nThat Oceans are--and Prayer--\nAnd that White Sustenance--\nDespair--\n",
