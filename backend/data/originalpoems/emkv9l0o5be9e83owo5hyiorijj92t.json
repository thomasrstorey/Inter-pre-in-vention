  "poem": "No Notice gave She, but a Change-\nNo Message, but a Sigh-\nFor Whom, the Time did not suffice\nThat She should specify.\nShe was not warm, though Summer shone\nNor scrupulous of cold\nThough Rime by Rime, the steady Frost\nUpon Her Bosom piled-\nOf shrinking ways-she did not fright\nThough all the Village looked-\nBut held Her gravity aloft-\nAnd met the gaze-direct-\nAnd when adjusted like a Seed\nIn careful fitted Ground\nUnto the Everlasting Spring\nAnd hindered but a Mound\nHer Warm return, if so she chose-\nAnd We-imploring drew-\nRemoved our invitation by\nAs Some She never knew-\n",
