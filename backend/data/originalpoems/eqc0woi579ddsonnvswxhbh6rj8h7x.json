  "poem": "It ceased to hurt me, though so slow\nI could not feel the Anguish go-\nBut only knew by looking back-\nThat something-had benumbed the Track-\nNor when it altered, I could say,\nFor I had worn it, every day,\nAs constant as the Childish frock-\nI hung upon the Peg, at night.\nBut not the Grief-that nestled close\nAs needles-ladies softly press\nTo Cushions Cheeks-\nTo keep their place-\nNor what consoled it, I could trace-\nExcept, whereas 'twas Wilderness-\nIt's better-almost Peace-\n",
