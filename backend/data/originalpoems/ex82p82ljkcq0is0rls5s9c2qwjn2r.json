  "poem": "If He were living—dare I ask—\nAnd how if He be dead—\nAnd so around the Words I went—\nOf meeting them—afraid—\nI hinted Changes—Lapse of Time—\nThe Surfaces of Years—\nI touched with Caution—lest they crack—\nAnd show me to my fears—\nReverted to adjoining Lives—\nAdroitly turning out\nWherever I suspected Graves—\n'Twas prudenter—I thought—\nAnd He—I pushed—with sudden force—\nIn face of the Suspense—\n\"Was buried\"—\"Buried\"! \"He!\"\nMy Life just holds the Trench—\n",
