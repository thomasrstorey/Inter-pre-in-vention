  "poem": "A precious—mouldering pleasure—'tis—\nTo meet an Antique Book—\nIn just the Dress his Century wore—\nA privilege—I think—\nHis venerable Hand to take—\nAnd warming in our own—\nA passage back—or two—to make—\nTo Times when he—was young—\nHis quaint opinions—to inspect—\nHis thought to ascertain\nOn Themes concern our mutual mind—\nThe Literature of Man—\nWhat interested Scholars—most—\nWhat Competitions ran—\nWhen Plato—was a Certainty—\nAnd Sophocles—a Man—\nWhen Sappho—was a living Girl—\nAnd Beatrice wore\nThe Gown that Dante—deified—\nFacts Centuries before\nHe traverses—familiar—\nAs One should come to Town—\nAnd tell you all your Dreams—were true—\nHe lived—where Dreams were born—\nHis presence is Enchantment—\nYou beg him not to go—\nOld Volume shake their Vellum Heads\nAnd tantalize—just so—\n",
