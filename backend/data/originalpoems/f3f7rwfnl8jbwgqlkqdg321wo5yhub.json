  "poem": "It always felt to me—a wrong\nTo that Old Moses—done—\nTo let him see—the Canaan—\nWithout the entering—\nAnd tho' in soberer moments—\nNo Moses there can be\nI'm satisfied—the Romance\nIn point of injury—\nSurpasses sharper stated—\nOf Stephen—or of Paul—\nFor these—were only put to death—\nWhile God's adroiter will\nOn Moses—seemed to fasten\nWith tantalizing Play\nAs Boy—should deal with lesser Boy—\nTo prove ability.\nThe fault—was doubtless Israel's—\nMyself—had banned the Tribes—\nAnd ushered Grand Old Moses\nIn Pentateuchal Robes\nUpon the Broad Possession\n'Twas little—But titled Him—to see—\nOld Man on Nebo! Late as this—\nMy justice bleeds—for Thee!\n",
