  "poem": "A Cloud withdrew from the Sky\nSuperior Glory be\nBut that Cloud and its Auxiliaries\nAre forever lost to me\nHad I but further scanned\nHad I secured the Glow\nIn an Hermetic Memory\nIt had availed me now.\nNever to pass the Angel\nWith a glance and a Bow\nTill I am firm in Heaven\nIs my intention now.\n",
