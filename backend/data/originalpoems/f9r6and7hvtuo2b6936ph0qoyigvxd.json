  "poem": "I would not paint—a picture—\nI'd rather be the One\nIts bright impossibility\nTo dwell—delicious—on—\nAnd wonder how the fingers feel\nWhose rare—celestial—stir—\nEvokes so sweet a Torment—\nSuch sumptuous—Despair—\nI would not talk, like Cornets—\nI'd rather be the One\nRaised softly to the Ceilings—\nAnd out, and easy on—\nThrough Villages of Ether—\nMyself endued Balloon\nBy but a lip of Metal—\nThe pier to my Pontoon—\nNor would I be a Poet—\nIt's finer—own the Ear—\nEnamored—impotent—content—\nThe License to revere,\nA privilege so awful\nWhat would the Dower be,\nHad I the Art to stun myself\nWith Bolts of Melody!\n",
