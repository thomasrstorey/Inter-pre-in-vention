  "poem": "Those fair—fictitious People—\nThe Women—plucked away\nFrom our familiar Lifetime—\nThe Men of Ivory—\nThose Boys and Girls, in Canvas—\nWho stay upon the Wall\nIn Everlasting Keepsake—\nCan Anybody tell?\nWe trust—in places perfecter—\nInheriting Delight\nBeyond our faint Conjecture—\nOur dizzy Estimate—\nRemembering ourselves, we trust—\nYet Blesseder—than We—\nThrough Knowing—where We only hope—\nReceiving—where we—pray—\nOf Expectation—also—\nAnticipating us\nWith transport, that would be a pain\nExcept for Holiness—\nEsteeming us—as Exile—\nThemself—admitted Home—\nThrough easy Miracle of Death—\nThe Way ourself, must come—\n",
