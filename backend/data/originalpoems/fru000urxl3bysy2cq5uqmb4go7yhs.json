  "poem": "I know a place where summer strives\nWith such a practised frost,\nShe each year leads her daisies back,\nRecording briefly, 'Lost.'\nBut when the south wind stirs the pools\nAnd struggles in the lanes,\nHer heart misgives her for her vow,\nAnd she pours soft refrains\nInto the lap of adamant,\nAnd spices, and the dew,\nThat stiffens quietly to quartz\nUpon her amber shoe.\n",
