  "poem": "Besides the Autumn poets sing\nA few prosaic days\nA little this side of the snow\nAnd that side of the Haze-\nA few incisive Mornings-\nA few Ascetic Eves-\nGone-Mr. Bryant's \"Golden Rod\"-\nAnd Mr. Thomson's \"sheaves.\"\nStill, is the bustle in the Brook-\nSealed are the spicy valves-\nMesmeric fingers softly touch\nThe Eyes of many Elves-\nPerhaps a squirrel may remain-\nMy sentiments to share-\nGrant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind-\nThy windy will to bear!\n",
