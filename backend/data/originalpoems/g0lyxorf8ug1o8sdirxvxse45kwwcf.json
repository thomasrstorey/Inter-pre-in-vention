  "poem": "Most she touched me by her muteness-\nMost she won me by the way\nShe presented her small figure-\nPlea itself-for Charity-\nWere a Crumb my whole possession-\nWere there famine in the land-\nWere it my resource from starving-\nCould I such a plea withstand-\nNot upon her knee to thank me\nSank this Beggar from the Sky-\nBut the Crumb partook-departed-\nAnd returned On High-\nI supposed-when sudden\nSuch a Praise began\n'Twas as Space sat singing\nTo herself-and men-\n'Twas the Winged Beggar-\nAfterward I learned\nTo her Benefactor\nMaking Gratitude\n",
