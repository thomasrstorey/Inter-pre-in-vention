  "poem": "It don't sound so terrible—quite—as it did—\nI run it over—\"Dead\", Brain, \"Dead.\"\nPut it in Latin—left of my school—\nSeems it don't shriek so—under rule.\nTurn it, a little—full in the face\nA Trouble looks bitterest—\nShift it—just—\nSay \"When Tomorrow comes this way—\nI shall have waded down one Day.\"\nI suppose it will interrupt me some\nTill I get accustomed—but then the Tomb\nLike other new Things—shows largest—then—\nAnd smaller, by Habit—\nIt's shrewder then\nPut the Thought in advance—a Year—\nHow like \"a fit\"—then—\nMurder—wear!\n",
