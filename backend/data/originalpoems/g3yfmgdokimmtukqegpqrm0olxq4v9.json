  "poem": "Morns like these—we parted—\nNoons like these—she rose—\nFluttering first—then firmer\nTo her fair repose.\nNever did she lisp it—\nIt was not for me—\nShe—was mute from transport—\nI—from agony—\nTill—the evening nearing\nOne the curtains drew—\nQuick! A Sharper rustling!\nAnd this linnet flew!\n",
