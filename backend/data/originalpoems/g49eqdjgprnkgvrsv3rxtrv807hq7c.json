  "poem": "As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies\nAs the Vulture teased\nForces the Broods in lonely Valleys\nAs the Tiger eased\nBy but a Crumb of Blood, fasts Scarlet\nTill he meet a Man\nDainty adorned with Veins and Tissues\nAnd partakes-his Tongue\nCooled by the Morsel for a moment\nGrows a fiercer thing\nTill he esteem his Dates and Cocoa\nA Nutrition mean\nI, of a finer Famine\nDeem my Supper dry\nFor but a Berry of Domingo\nAnd a Torrid Eye.\n",
