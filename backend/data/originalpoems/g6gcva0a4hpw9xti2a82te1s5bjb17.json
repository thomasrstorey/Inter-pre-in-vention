  "poem": "Delayed till she had ceased to know-\nDelayed till in its vest of snow\nHer loving bosom lay-\nAn hour behind the fleeting breath-\nLater by just an hour than Death-\nOh lagging Yesterday!\nCould she have guessed that it would be-\nCould but a crier of the joy\nHave climbed the distant hill-\nHad not the bliss so slow a pace\nWho knows but this surrendered face\nWere undefeated still?\nOh if there may departing be\nAny forgot by Victory\nIn her imperial round-\nShow them this meek appareled thing\nThat could not stop to be a king-\nDoubtful if it be crowned!\n",
