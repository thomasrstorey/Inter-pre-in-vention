  "poem": "I'm sorry for the Dead—Today—\nIt's such congenial times\nOld Neighbors have at fences—\nIt's time o' year for Hay.\nAnd Broad—Sunburned Acquaintance\nDiscourse between the Toil—\nAnd laugh, a homely species\nThat makes the Fences smile—\nIt seems so straight to lie away\nFrom all of the noise of Fields—\nThe Busy Carts—the fragrant Cocks—\nThe Mower's Metre—Steals—\nA Trouble lest they're homesick—\nThose Farmers—and their Wives—\nSet separate from the Farming—\nAnd all the Neighbors' lives—\nA Wonder if the Sepulchre\nDon't feel a lonesome way—\nWhen Men—and Boys—and Carts—and June,\nGo down the Fields to \"Hay\"—\n",
