  "poem": "UP with the sun, the breeze arose,\nAcross the talking corn she goes,\nAnd smooth she rustles far and wide\nThrough all the voiceful countryside.\nThrough all the land her tale she tells;\nShe spins, she tosses, she compels\nThe kites, the clouds, the windmill sails\nAnd all the trees in all the dales.\nGod calls us, and the day prepares\nWith nimble, gay and gracious airs:\nAnd from Penzance to Maidenhead\nThe roads last night He watered.\nGod calls us from inglorious ease,\nForth and to travel with the breeze\nWhile, swift and singing, smooth and strong\nShe gallops by the fields along.\n",
