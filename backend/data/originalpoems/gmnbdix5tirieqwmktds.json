That will do!\nPut me in on the firmest side,\nSo I shall never fall;\nFor we must ride to the Judgment,\nAnd it's partly down hill.\nBut never I mind the bridges,\nAnd never I mind the sea;\nHeld fast in everlasting race\nBy my own choice and thee.\nGood-by to the life I used to lives,\nAnd the world I used to know;\nAnd kiss the hills for me, just once;\nNow I am ready to go!\n","children":"NULL","orig_src":"","poem_num":0,"links":[]}
