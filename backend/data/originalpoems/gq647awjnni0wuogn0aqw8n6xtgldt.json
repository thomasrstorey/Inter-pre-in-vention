  "poem": "She dealt her pretty words like Blades-\nHow glittering they shone-\nAnd every One unbared a Nerve\nOr wantoned with a Bone-\nShe never deemed-she hurt-\nThat-is not Steel's Affair-\nA vulgar grimace in the Flesh-\nHow ill the Creatures bear-\nTo Ache is human-not polite-\nThe Film upon the eye\nMortality's old Custom-\nJust locking up-to Die.\n",
