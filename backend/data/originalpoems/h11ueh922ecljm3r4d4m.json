  "poem": "I never told the buried gold\nUpon the hill-that lies-\nI saw the sun-his plunder done\nCrouch low to guard his prize.\nHe stood as near\nAs stood you here-\nA pace had been between-\nDid but a snake bisect the brake\nMy life had forfeit been.\nThat was a wondrous booty-\nI hope 'twas honest gained.\nThose were the fairest ingots\nThat ever kissed the spade!\nWhether to keep the secret-\nWhether to reveal-\nWhether as I ponder\nKidd will sudden sail-\nCould a shrewd advise me\nWe might e'en divide-\nShould a shrewd betray me-\nAtropos decide!\n",
