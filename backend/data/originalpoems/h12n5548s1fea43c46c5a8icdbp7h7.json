  "poem": "'Tis so appalling-it exhilarates-\nSo over Horror, it half Captivates-\nThe Soul stares after it, secure-\nA Sepulchre, fears frost, no more-\nTo scan a Ghost, is faint-\nBut grappling, conquers it-\nHow easy, Torment, now-\nSuspense kept sawing so-\nThe Truth, is Bald, and Cold-\nBut that will hold-\nIf any are not sure-\nWe show them-prayer-\nBut we, who know,\nStop hoping, now-\nLooking at Death, is Dying-\nJust let go the Breath-\nAnd not the pillow at your Cheek\nSo Slumbereth-\nOthers, Can wrestle-\nYours, is done-\nAnd so of Woe, bleak dreaded-come,\nIt sets the Fright at liberty-\nAnd Terror's free-\nGay, Ghastly, Holiday!\n",
