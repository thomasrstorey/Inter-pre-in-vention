  "poem": "It would never be Common—more—I said—\nDifference—had begun—\nMany a bitterness—had been—\nBut that old sort—was done—\nOr—if it sometime—showed—as 'twill—\nUpon the Downiest—Morn—\nSuch bliss—had I—for all the years—\n'Twould give an Easier—pain—\nI'd so much joy—I told it—Red—\nUpon my simple Cheek—\nI felt it publish—in my Eye—\n'Twas needless—any speak—\nI walked—as wings—my body bore—\nThe feet—I former used—\nUnnecessary—now to me—\nAs boots—would be—to Birds—\nI put my pleasure all abroad—\nI dealth a word of Gold\nTo every Creature—that I met—\nAnd Dowered—all the World—\nWhen—suddenly—my Riches shrank—\nA Goblin—drank my Dew—\nMy Palaces—dropped tenantless—\nMyself—was beggared—too—\nI clutched at sounds—\nI groped at shapes—\nI touched the tops of Films—\nI felt the Wilderness roll back\nAlong my Golden lines—\nThe Sackcloth—hangs upon the nail—\nThe Frock I used to wear—\nBut where my moment of Brocade—\nMy—drop—of India?\n",
