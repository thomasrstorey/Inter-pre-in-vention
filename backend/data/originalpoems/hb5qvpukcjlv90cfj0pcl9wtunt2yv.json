  "poem": "An awful Tempest mashed the air-\nThe clouds were gaunt, and few-\nA Black-as of a Spectre's Cloak\nHid Heaven and Earth from view.\nThe creatures chuckled on the Roofs-\nAnd whistled in the air-\nAnd shook their fists-\nAnd gnashed their teeth-\nAnd swung their frenzied hair.\nThe morning lit-the Birds arose-\nThe Monster's faded eyes\nTurned slowly to his native coast-\nAnd peace-was Paradise!\n",
