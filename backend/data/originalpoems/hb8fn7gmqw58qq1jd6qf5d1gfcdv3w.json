  "poem": "On this long storm the Rainbow rose-\nOn this late Morn-the Sun-\nThe clouds-like listless Elephants-\nHorizons-straggled down-\nThe Birds rose smiling, in their nests-\nThe gales-indeed-were done-\nAlas, how heedless were the eyes-\nOn whom the summer shone!\nThe quiet nonchalance of death-\nNo Daybreak-can bestir-\nThe slow-Archangel's syllables\nMust awaken her!\n",
