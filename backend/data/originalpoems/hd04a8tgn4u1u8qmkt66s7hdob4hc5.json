  "poem": "Tho' I get home how late—how late—\nSo I get home - 'twill compensate—\nBetter will be the Ecstasy\nThat they have done expecting me—\nWhen Night—descending—dumb—and dark—\nThey hear my unexpected knock—\nTransporting must the moment be—\nBrewed from decades of Agony!\nTo think just how the fire will burn—\nJust how long-cheated eyes will turn—\nTo wonder what myself will say,\nAnd what itself, will say to me—\nBeguiles the Centuries of way!\n",
