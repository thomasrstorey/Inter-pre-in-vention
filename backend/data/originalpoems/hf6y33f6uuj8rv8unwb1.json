  "poem": "Her final summer was it,\nAnd yet we guessed it not;\nIf tenderer industriousness\nPervaded her, we thought\nA further force of life\nDeveloped from within,--\nWhen Death lit all the shortness up,\nAnd made the hurry plain.\nWe wondered at our blindness,--\nWhen nothing was to see\nBut her Carrara guide-post,--\nAt our stupidity\nWhen, duller than our dulness,\nThe busy darling lay,\nSo busy was she, finishing,\nSo leisurely were we!\n",
