  "poem": "There is a Languor of the Life\nMore imminent than Pain-\n'Tis Pain's Successor-When the Soul\nHas suffered all it can-\nA Drowsiness-diffuses-\nA Dimness like a Fog\nEnvelops Consciousness-\nAs Mists-obliterate a Crag.\nThe Surgeon-does not blanch-at pain\nHis Habit-is severe-\nBut tell him that it ceased to feel-\nThe Creature lying there-\nAnd he will tell you-skill is late-\nA Mightier than He-\nHas ministered before Him-\nThere's no Vitality.\n",
