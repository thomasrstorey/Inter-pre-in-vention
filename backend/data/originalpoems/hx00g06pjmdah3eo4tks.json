  "poem": "A little bread-a crust-a crumb-\nA little trust-a demijohn-\nCan keep the soul alive-\nNot portly, mind! but breathing-warm-\nConscious-as old Napoleon,\nThe night before the Crown!\nA modest lot-A fame petite-\nA brief Campaign of sting and sweet\nIs plenty! Is enough!\nA Sailor's business is the shore!\nA Soldier's-balls! Who asketh more,\nMust seek the neighboring life!\n",
