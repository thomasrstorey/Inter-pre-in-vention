  "poem": "As Watchers hang upon the East,\nAs Beggars revel at a feast\nBy savory Fancy spread-\nAs brooks in deserts babble sweet\nOn ear too far for the delight,\nHeaven beguiles the tired.\nAs that same watcher, when the East\nOpens the lid of Amethyst\nAnd lets the morning go-\nThat Beggar, when an honored Guest,\nThose thirsty lips to flagons pressed,\nHeaven to us, if true.\n",
