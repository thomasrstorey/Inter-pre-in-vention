  "poem": "They shut me up in Prose --\nAs when a little Girl\nThey put me in the Closet --\nBecause they liked me \"still\" --\nStill! Could themself have peeped --\nAnd seen my Brain -- go round --\nThey might as wise have lodged a Bird\nFor Treason -- in the Pound --\nHimself has but to will\nAnd easy as a Star\nAbolish his Captivity --\nAnd laugh -- No more have I --\n",
