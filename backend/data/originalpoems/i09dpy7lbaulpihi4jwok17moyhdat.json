  "poem": "Because I could not stop for Death,\nHe kindly stopped for me;\nThe carriage held but just ourselves\nAnd Immortality.\nWe slowly drove, he knew no haste,\nAnd I had put away\nMy labor, and my leisure too,\nFor his civility.\nWe passed the school where children played,\nTheir lessons scarcely done;\nWe passed the fields of gazing grain,\nWe passed the setting sun.\nWe paused before a house that seemed\nA swelling of the ground;\nThe roof was scarcely visible.\nThe cornice but a mound.\nSince then 'tis centuries; but each\nFeels shorter than the day\nI first surmised the horses' heads\nWere toward eternity.\n",
