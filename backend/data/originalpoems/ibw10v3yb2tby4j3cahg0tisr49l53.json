Cocoon below!\nStealthy Cocoon, why hide you so\nWhat all the world suspect?\nAn hour, and gay on every tree\nYour secret, perched in ecstasy\nDefies imprisonment!\nAn hour in Chrysalis to pass,\nThen gay above receding grass\nA Butterfly to go!\nA moment to interrogate,\nThen wiser than a \"Surrogate,\"\nThe Universe to know!\n",
