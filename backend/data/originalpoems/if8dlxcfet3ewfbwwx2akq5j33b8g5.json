  "poem": "Her—\"last Poems\"—\nPoets—ended—\nSilver—perished—with her Tongue—\nNot on Record—bubbled other,\nFlute—or Woman—\nSo divine—\nNot unto its Summer—Morning\nRobin—uttered Half the Tune—\nGushed too free for the Adoring—\nFrom the Anglo-Florentine—\nLate—the Praise—\n'Tis dull—conferring\nOn the Head too High to Crown—\nDiadem—or Ducal Showing—\nBe its Grave—sufficient sign—\nNought—that We—No Poet's Kinsman—\nSuffocate—with easy woe—\nWhat, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom—\nPut Her down—in Italy?\n",
