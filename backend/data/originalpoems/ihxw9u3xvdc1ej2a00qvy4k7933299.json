  "poem": "Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple\nLeaping like Leopards to the Sky\nThen at the feet of the old Horizon\nLaying her spotted Face to die\nStooping as low as the Otter's Window\nTouching the Roof and tinting the Barn\nKissing her Bonnet to the Meadow\nAnd the Juggler of Day is gone\n",
