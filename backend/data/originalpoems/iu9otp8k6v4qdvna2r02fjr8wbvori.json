  "poem": "The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.\nThe heaven we chase\nLike the June bee\nBefore the school-boy\nInvites the race;\nStoops to an easy clover\nDips--evades--teases--deploys;\nThen to the royal clouds\nLifts his light pinnace\nHeedless of the boy\nStaring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.\nHomesick for steadfast honey,\nAh! the bee flies not\nThat brews that rare variety.\n",
