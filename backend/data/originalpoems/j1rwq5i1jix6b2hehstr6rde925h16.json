  "poem": "I like to see it lap the miles,\nAnd lick the valleys up,\nAnd stop to feed itself at tanks;\nAnd then, prodigious, step\nAround a pile of mountains,\nAnd, supercilious, peer\nIn shanties by the sides of roads;\nAnd then a quarry pare\nTo fit its sides, and crawl between,\nComplaining all the while\nIn horrid, hooting stanza;\nThen chase itself down the hill\nAnd neigh like Boanerges;\nThen, punctual as a star,\nStop - docile and omnipotent -\nAt its own stable door.\n",
