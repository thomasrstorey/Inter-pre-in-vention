  "poem": "I died for beauty but was scarce\nAdjusted in the tomb,\nWhen one who died for truth was lain\nIn an adjoining room.\nHe questioned softly why I failed?\n'For beauty,' I replied.\n'And I for truth,--the two are one;\nWe brethren are,' he said.\nAnd so, as kinsmen met a night,\nWe talked between the rooms,\nUntil the moss had reached our lips,\nAnd covered up our names.\n",
