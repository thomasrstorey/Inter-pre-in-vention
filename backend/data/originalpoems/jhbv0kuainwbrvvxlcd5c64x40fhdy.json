  "poem": "I'm ceded—I've stopped being Theirs—\nThe name They dropped upon my face\nWith water, in the country church\nIs finished using, now,\nAnd They can put it with my Dolls,\nMy childhood, and the string of spools,\nI've finished threading—too—\nBaptized, before, without the choice,\nBut this time, consciously, of Grace—\nUnto supremest name—\nCalled to my Full—The Crescent dropped—\nExistence's whole Arc, filled up,\nWith one small Diadem.\nMy second Rank—too small the first—\nCrowned—Crowing—on my Father's breast—\nA half unconscious Queen—\nBut this time—Adequate—Erect,\nWith Will to choose, or to reject,\nAnd I choose, just a Crown—\n",
