  "poem": "The Outer—from the Inner\nDerives its Magnitude—\n'Tis Duke, or Dwarf, according\nAs is the Central Mood—\nThe fine—unvarying Axis\nThat regulates the Wheel—\nThough Spokes—spin—more conspicuous\nAnd fling a dust—the while.\nThe Inner—paints the Outer—\nThe Brush without the Hand—\nIts Picture publishes—precise—\nAs is the inner Brand—\nOn fine—Arterial Canvas—\nA Cheek—perchance a Brow—\nThe Star's whole Secret—in the Lake—\nEyes were not meant to know.\n",
