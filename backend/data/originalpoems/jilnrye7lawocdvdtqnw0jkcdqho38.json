  "poem": "Through lane it lay—through bramble—\nThrough clearing and through wood—\nBanditti often passed us\nUpon the lonely road.\nThe wolf came peering curious—\nThe owl looked puzzled down—\nThe serpent's satin figure\nGlid stealthily along—\nThe tempests touched our garments—\nThe lightning's poinards gleamed—\nFierce from the Crag above us\nThe hungry Vulture screamed—\nThe satyr's fingers beckoned—\nThe valley murmured \"Come\"—\nThese were the mates—\nThis was the road\nThose children fluttered home.\n",
