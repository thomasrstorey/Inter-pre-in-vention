  "poem": "Two Travellers perishing in Snow\nThe Forests as they froze\nTogether heard them strengthening\nEach other with the words\nThat Heaven if Heaven-must contain\nWhat Either left behind\nAnd then the cheer too solemn grew\nFor language, and the wind\nLong steps across the features took\nThat Love had touched the Morn\nWith reverential Hyacinth-\nThe taleless Days went on\nTill Mystery impatient drew\nAnd those They left behind\nLed absent, were procured of Heaven\nAs Those first furnished, said-\n",
