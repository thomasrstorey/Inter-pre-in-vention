  "poem": "It struck me every day\nThe lightning was as new\nAs if the cloud that instant slit\nAnd let the fire through.\nIt burned me in the night,\nIt blistered in my dream;\nIt sickened fresh upon my sight\nWith every morning's beam.\nI thought that storm was brief,--\nThe maddest, quickest by;\nBut Nature lost the date of this,\nAnd left it in the sky.\n",
