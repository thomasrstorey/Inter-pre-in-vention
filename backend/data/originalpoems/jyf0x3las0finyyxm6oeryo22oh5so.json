  "poem": "Is all that pins the Soul\nThat stands for Deity, to Mine,\nUpon my side the Veil-\nOnce witnessed of the Gauze-\nIts name is put away\nAs far from mine, as if no plight\nHad printed yesterday,\nIn tender-solemn Alphabet,\nMy eyes just turned to see,\nWhen it was smuggled by my sight\nInto Eternity-\nMore Hands-to hold-These are but Two-\nOne more new-mailed Nerve\nJust granted, for the Peril's sake-\nSome striding-Giant-Love-\nSo greater than the Gods can show,\nThey slink before the Clay,\nThat not for all their Heaven can boast\nWill let its Keepsake-go\n",
