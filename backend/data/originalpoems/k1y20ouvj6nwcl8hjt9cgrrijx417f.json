  "poem": "I never felt at Home—Below—-\nAnd in the Handsome Skies\nI shall not feel at Home—I know—\nI don't like Paradise—\nBecause it's Sunday—all the time—\nAnd Recess—never comes—\nAnd Eden'll be so lonesome\nBright Wednesday Afternoons—\nIf God could make a visit—\nOr ever took a Nap—\nSo not to see us—but they say\nHimself—a Telescope\nPerennial beholds us—\nMyself would run away\nFrom Him—and Holy Ghost—and All—\nBut there's the \"Judgement Day\"!\n",
