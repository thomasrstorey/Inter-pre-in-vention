  "poem": "It sifts from Leaden Sieves-\nIt powders all the Wood.\nIt fills with Alabaster Wool\nThe Wrinkles of the Road-\nIt makes an Even Face\nOf Mountain, and of Plain-\nUnbroken Forehead from the East\nUnto the East again-\nIt reaches to the Fence-\nIt wraps it Rail by Rail\nTill it is lost in Fleeces-\nIt deals Celestial Vail\nTo Stump, and Stack-and Stem-\nA Summer's empty Room-\nAcres of Joints, where Harvests were,\nRecordless, but for them--\nIt Ruffles Wrists of Posts\nAs Ankles of a Queen-\nThen stills its Artisans-like Ghosts-\nDenying they have been-\n",
