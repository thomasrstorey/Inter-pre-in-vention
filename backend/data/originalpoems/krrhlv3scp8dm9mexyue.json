  "poem": "The Love a Life can show Below\nIs but a filament, I know,\nOf that diviner thing\nThat faints upon the face of Noon-\nAnd smites the Tinder in the Sun-\nAnd hinders Gabriel's Wing-\n'Tis this-in Music-hints and sways-\nAnd far abroad on Summer days-\nDistils uncertain pain-\n'Tis this enamors in the East-\nAnd tints the Transit in the West\nWith harrowing Iodine-\n'Tis this-invites-appalls-endows-\nFlits-glimmers-proves-dissolves-\nReturns-suggests-convicts-enchants-\nThen-flings in Paradise-\n",
