  "poem": "The Sun—just touched the Morning—\nThe Morning—Happy thing—\nSupposed that He had come to dwell—\nAnd Life would all be Spring!\nShe felt herself supremer—\nA Raised—Ethereal Thing!\nHenceforth—for Her—What Holiday!\nMeanwhile—Her wheeling King—\nTrailed—slow—along the Orchards—\nHis haughty—spangled Hems—\nLeaving a new necessity!\nThe want of Diadems!\nThe Morning—fluttered—staggered—\nFelt feebly—for Her Crown—\nHer unanointed forehead—\nHenceforth—Her only One!\n",
