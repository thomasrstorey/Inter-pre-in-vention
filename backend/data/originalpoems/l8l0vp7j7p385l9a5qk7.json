  "poem": "Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him--\nTell him the page I didn't write;\nTell him I only said the syntax,\nAnd left the verb and the pronoun out.\nTell him just how the fingers hurried\nThen how they waded, slow, slow, slow-\nAnd then you wished you had eyes in your pages,\nSo you could see what moved them so.\n'Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,\nYou guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;\nYou could hear the bodice tug, behind you,\nAs if it held but the might of a child;\nYou almost pitied it, you, it worked so.\nTell him--No, you may quibble there,\nFor it would split his heart to know it,\nAnd then you and I were silenter.\n'Tell him night finished before we finished\nAnd the old clock kept neighing 'day!'\nAnd you got sleepy and begged to be ended--\nWhat could it hinder so, to say?\nTell him just how she sealed you, cautious\nBut if he ask where you are hid\nUntil to-morrow,--happy letter!\nGesture, coquette, and shake your head!'\n",
