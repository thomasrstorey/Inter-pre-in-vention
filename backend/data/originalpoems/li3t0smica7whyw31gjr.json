  "poem": "Better—than Music! For I—who heard it—\nI was used—to the Birds—before—\nThis—was different—'Twas Translation—\nOf all tunes I knew—and more—\n'Twasn't contained—like other stanza—\nNo one could play it—the second time—\nBut the Composer—perfect Mozart—\nPerish with him—that Keyless Rhyme!\nSo—Children—told how Brooks in Eden—\nBubbled a better—Melody—\nQuaintly infer—Eve's great surrender—\nUrging the feet—that would—not—fly—\nChildren—matured—are wiser—mostly—\nEden—a legend—dimly told—\nEve—and the Anguish—Grandame's story—\nBut—I was telling a tune—I heard—\nNot such a strain—the Church—baptizes—\nWhen the last Saint—goes up the Aisles—\nNot such a stanza splits the silence—\nWhen the Redemption strikes her Bells—\nLet me not spill—its smallest cadence—\nHumming—for promise—when alone—\nHumming—until my faint Rehearsal—\nDrop into tune—around the Throne—\n",
