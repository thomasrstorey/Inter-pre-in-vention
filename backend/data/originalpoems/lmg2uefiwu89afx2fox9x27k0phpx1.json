  "poem": "One Sister have I in our house,\nAnd one, a hedge away.\nThere's only one recorded,\nBut both belong to me.\nOne came the road that I came-\nAnd wore my last year's gown-\nThe other, as a bird her nest,\nBuilded our hearts among.\nShe did not sing as we did-\nIt was a different tune-\nHerself to her a music\nAs Bumble bee of June.\nToday is far from Childhood-\nBut up and down the hills\nI held her hand the tighter-\nWhich shortened all the miles-\nAnd still her hum\nThe years among,\nDeceives the Butterfly;\nStill in her Eye\nThe Violets lie\nMouldered this many May.\nI spilt the dew-\nBut took the morn-\nI chose this single star\nFrom out the wide night's numbers-\nSue - forevermore!\n",
