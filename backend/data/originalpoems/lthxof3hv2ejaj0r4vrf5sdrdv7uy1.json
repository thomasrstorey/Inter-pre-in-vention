  "poem": "The Wind didn't come from the Orchard—today—\nFurther than that—\nNor stop to play with the Hay—\nNor joggle a Hat—\nHe's a transitive fellow—very—\nRely on that—\nIf He leave a Bur at the door\nWe know He has climbed a Fir—\nBut the Fir is Where—Declare—\nWere you ever there?\nIf He brings Odors of Clovers—\nAnd that is His business—not Ours—\nThen He has been with the Mowers—\nWhetting away the Hours\nTo sweet pauses of Hay—\nHis Way—of a June Day—\nIf He fling Sand, and Pebble—\nLittle Boys Hats—and Stubble—\nWith an occasional Steeple—\nAnd a hoarse \"Get out of the way, I say,\"\nWho'd be the fool to stay?\nWould you—Say—\nWould you be the fool to stay?\n",
