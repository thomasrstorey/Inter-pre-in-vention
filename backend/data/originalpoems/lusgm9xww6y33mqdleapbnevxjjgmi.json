  "poem": "I had not minded—Walls—\nWere Universe—one Rock—\nAnd fr I heard his silver Call\nThe other side the Block—\nI'd tunnel—till my Groove\nPushed sudden thro' to his—\nThen my face take her Recompense—\nThe looking in his Eyes—\nBut 'tis a single Hair—\nA filament—a law—\nA Cobweb—wove in Adamant—\nA Battlement—of Straw—\nA limit like the Veil\nUnto the Lady's face—\nBut every Mesh—a Citadel—\nAnd Dragons—in the Crease—\n",
