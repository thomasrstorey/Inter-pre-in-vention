  "poem": "Let Us play Yesterday-\nI-the Girl at school-\nYou-and Eternity-the\nUntold Tale-\nEasing my famine\nAt my Lexicon-\nLogarithm-had I-for Drink-\n'Twas a dry Wine-\nSomewhat different-must be-\nDreams tint the Sleep-\nCunning Reds of Morning\nMake the Blind-leap-\nStill at the Egg-life-\nChafing the Shell-\nWhen you troubled the Ellipse-\nAnd the Bird fell-\nManacles be dim-they say-\nTo the new Free-\nLiberty-Commoner-\nNever could-to me-\n'Twas my last gratitude\nWhen I slept-at night-\n'Twas the first Miracle\nLet in-with Light-\nCan the Lark resume the Shell-\nEasier-for the Sky-\nWouldn't Bonds hurt more\nThan Yesterday?\nWouldn't Dungeons sorer frate\nOn the Man-free-\nJust long enough to taste-\nThen-doomed new-\nGod of the Manacle\nAs of the Free-\nTake not my Liberty\nAway from Me-\n",
