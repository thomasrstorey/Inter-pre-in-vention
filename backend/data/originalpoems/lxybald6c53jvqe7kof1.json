  "poem": "These are the days when Birds come back-\nA very few-a Bird or two-\nTo take a backward look.\nThese are the days when skies resume\nThe old-old sophistries of June-\nA blue and gold mistake.\nOh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee-\nAlmost thy plausibility\nInduces my belief.\nTill ranks of seeds their witness bear-\nAnd softly thro' the altered air\nHurries a timid leaf.\nOh Sacrament of summer days,\nOh Last Communion in the Haze-\nPermit a child to join.\nThy sacred emblems to partake-\nThey consecrated bread to take\nAnd thine immortal wine!\n",
