  "poem": "The cricket sang,\nAnd set the sun,\nAnd workmen finished, one by one,\nTheir seam the day upon.\nThe low grass loaded with the dew,\nThe twilight stood as strangers do\nWith hat in hand, polite and new,\nTo stay as if, or go.\nA vastness, as a neighbor, came,--\nA wisdom without face or name,\nA peace, as hemispheres at home,--\nAnd so the night became.\n",
