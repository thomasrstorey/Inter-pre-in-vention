  "poem": "He told a homely tale\nAnd spotted it with tears-\nUpon his infant face was set\nThe Cicatrice of years-\nAll crumpled was the cheek\nNo other kiss had known\nThan flake of snow, divided with\nThe Redbreast of the Barn-\nIf Mother-in the Grave-\nOr Father-on the Sea-\nOr Father in the Firmament-\nOr Brethren, had he-\nIf Commonwealth below,\nOr Commonwealth above\nHave missed a Barefoot Citizen-\nI've ransomed it-alive-\n",
