  "poem": "A Dying Tiger-moaned for Drink-\nI hunted all the Sand-\nI caught the Dripping of a Rock\nAnd bore it in my Hand-\nHis Mighty Balls-in death were thick-\nBut searching-I could see\nA Vision on the Retina\nOf Water-and of me-\n'Twas not my blame-who sped too slow-\n'Twas not his blame-who died\nWhile I was reaching him-\nBut 'twas-the fact that He was dead-\n",
