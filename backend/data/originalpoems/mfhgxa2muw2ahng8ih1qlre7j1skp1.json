  "poem": "Glee—The great storm is over—\nFour—have recovered the Land—\nForty—gone down together—\nInto the boiling Sand—\nRing—for the Scant Salvation—\nToll—for the bonnie Souls—\nNeighbor—and friend—and Bridegroom—\nSpinning upon the Shoals—\nHow they will tell the Story—\nWhen Winter shake the Door—\nTill the Children urge—\nBut the Forty—\nDid they—come back no more?\nThen a softness—suffuse the Story—\nAnd a silence—the Teller's eye—\nAnd the Children—no further question—\nAnd only the Sea—reply—\n",
