  "poem": "My period had come for Prayer-\nNo other Art-would do-\nMy Tactics missed a rudiment-\nCreator-Was it you?\nGod grows above-so those who pray\nHorizons-must ascend-\nAnd so I stepped upon the North\nTo see this Curious Friend-\nHis House was not-no sign had He-\nBy Chimney-nor by Door\nCould I infer his Residence-\nVast Prairies of Air\nUnbroken by a Settler-\nWere all that I could see-\nInfinitude-Had'st Thou no Face\nThat I might look on Thee?\nThe Silence condescended-\nCreation stopped-for Me-\nBut awed beyond my errand-\nI worshipped-did not \"pray\"-\n",
