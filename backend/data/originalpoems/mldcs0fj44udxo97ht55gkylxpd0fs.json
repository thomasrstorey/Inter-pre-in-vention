  "poem": "Grief is a Mouse-\nAnd chooses Wainscot in the Breast\nFor His Shy House-\nAnd baffles quest-\nGrief is a Thief-quick startled-\nPricks His Ear-report to hear\nOf that Vast Dark-\nThat swept His Being-back-\nGrief is a Juggler-boldest at the Play-\nLest if He flinch-the eye that way\nPounce on His Bruises-One-say-or Three-\nGrief is a Gourmand-spare His luxury-\nBest Grief is Tongueless-before He'll tell-\nBurn Him in the Public Square-\nHis Ashes-will\nPossibly-if they refuse-How then know-\nSince a Rack couldn't coax a syllable-now.\n",
