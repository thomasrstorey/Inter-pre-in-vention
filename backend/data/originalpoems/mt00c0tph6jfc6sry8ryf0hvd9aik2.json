  "poem": "It was given to me by the Gods-\nWhen I was a little Girl-\nThey given us Presents most-you know-\nWhen we are new-and small.\nI kept it in my Hand-\nI never put it down-\nI did not dare to eat-or sleep-\nFor fear it would be gone-\nI heard such words as \"Rich\"-\nWhen hurrying to school-\nFrom lips at Corners of the Streets-\nAnd wrestled with a smile.\nRich! 'Twas Myself-was rich-\nTo take the name of Gold-\nAnd Gold to own-in solid Bars-\nThe Difference-made me bold-\n",
