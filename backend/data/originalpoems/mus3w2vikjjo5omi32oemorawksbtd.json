  "poem": "Victory comes late-\nAnd is held low to freezing lips-\nToo rapt with frost\nTo take it-\nHow sweet it would have tasted-\nJust a Drop-\nWas God so economical?\nHis Table's spread too high for Us-\nUnless We dine on tiptoe-\nCrumbs-fit such little mouths-\nCherries-suit Robbins-\nThe Eagle's Golden Breakfast strangles-Them-\nGod keep His Oath to Sparrows-\nWho of little Love-know how to starve-\n",
