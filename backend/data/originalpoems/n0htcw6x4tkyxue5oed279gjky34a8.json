  "poem": "A solemn thing-it was-I said-\nA woman-white-to be-\nAnd wear-if God should count me fit-\nHer blameless mystery-\nA hallowed thing-to drop a life\nInto the purple well-\nToo plummetless-that it return-\nEternity-until-\nI pondered how the bliss would look-\nAnd would it feel as big-\nWhen I could take it in my hand-\nAs hovering-seen-through fog-\nAnd then-the size of this \"small\" life-\nThe Sages-call it small-\nSwelled-like Horizons-in my vest-\nAnd I sneered-softly-\"small\"!\n",
