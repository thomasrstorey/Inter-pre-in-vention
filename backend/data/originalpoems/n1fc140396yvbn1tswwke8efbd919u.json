  "poem": "\"Sic transit gloria mundi,\"\n\"How doth the busy bee,\"\n\"Dum vivimus vivamus,\"\nI stay mine enemy!\nOh \"veni, vidi, vici!\"\nOh caput cap-a-pie!\nAnd oh \"memento mori\"\nWhen I am far from thee!\nHurrah for Peter Parley!\nHurrah for Daniel Boone!\nThree cheers, sir, for the gentleman\nWho first observed the moon!\nPeter, put up the sunshine;\nPatti, arrange the stars;\nTell Luna, tea is waiting,\nAnd call your brother Mars!\nPut down the apple, Adam,\nAnd come away with me,\nSo shalt thou have a pippin\nFrom off my father's tree!\nI climb the \"Hill of Science,\"\nI \"view the landscape o'er;\"\nSuch transcendental prospect,\nI ne'er beheld before!\nUnto the Legislature\nMy country bids me go;\nI'll take my india rubbers,\nIn case the wind should blow!\nDuring my education,\nIt was announced to me\nThat gravitation, stumbling,\nFell from an apple tree!\nThe earth upon an axis\nWas once supposed to turn,\nBy way of a gymnastic\nIn honor of the sun!\nIt was the brave Columbus,\nA sailing o'er the tide,\nWho notified the nations\nOf where I would reside!\nMortality is fatal-\nGentility is fine,\nRascality, heroic,\nInsolvency, sublime!\nOur Fathers being weary,\nLaid down on Bunker Hill;\nAnd tho' full many a morning,\nYet they are sleeping still,-\nThe trumpet, sir, shall wake them,\nIn dreams I see them rise,\nEach with a solemn musket\nA marching to the skies!\nA coward will remain, Sir,\nUntil the fight is done;\nBut an immortal hero\nWill take his hat, and run!\nGood bye, Sir, I am going;\nMy country calleth me;\nAllow me, Sir, at parting,\nTo wipe my weeping e'e.\nIn token of our friendship\nAccept this \"Bonnie Doon,\"\nAnd when the hand that plucked it\nHath passed beyond the moon,\nThe memory of my ashes\nWill consolation be;\nThen, farewell, Tuscarora,\nAnd farewell, Sir, to thee!\n",
