  "poem": "I have a Bird in spring\nWhich for myself doth sing-\nThe spring decoys.\nAnd as the summer nears-\nAnd as the Rose appears,\nRobin is gone.\nYet do I not repine\nKnowing that Bird of mine\nThough flown-\nLearneth beyond the sea\nMelody new for me\nAnd will return.\nFast is a safer hand\nHeld in a truer Land\nAre mine-\nAnd though they now depart,\nTell I my doubting heart\nThey're thine.\nIn a serener Bright,\nIn a more golden light\nI see\nEach little doubt and fear,\nEach little discord here\nRemoved.\nThen will I not repine,\nKnowing that Bird of mine\nThough flown\nShall in a distant tree\nBright melody for me\nReturn.\n",
