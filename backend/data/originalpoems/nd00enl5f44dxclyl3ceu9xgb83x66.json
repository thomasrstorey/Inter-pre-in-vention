  "poem": "I envy Seas, whereon He rides-\nI envy Spokes of Wheels\nOf Chariots, that Him convey-\nI envy Crooked Hills\nThat gaze upon His journey-\nHow easy All can see\nWhat is forbidden utterly\nAs Heaven-unto me!\nI envy Nests of Sparrows-\nThat dot His distant Eaves-\nThe wealthy Fly, upon His Pane-\nThe happy-happy Leaves-\nThat just abroad His Window\nHave Summer's leave to play-\nThe Ear Rings of Pizarro\nCould not obtain for me-\nI envy Light-that wakes Him-\nAnd Bells-that boldly ring\nTo tell Him it is Noon, abroad-\nMyself-be Noon to Him-\nYet interdict-my Blossom-\nAnd abrogate-my Bee-\nLest Noon in Everlasting Night-\nDrop Gabriel-and Me-\n",
