  "poem": "Of Brussels—it was not—\nOf Kidderminster? Nay—\nThe Winds did buy it of the Woods—\nThey—sold it unto me\nIt was a gentle price—\nThe poorest—could afford—\nIt was within the frugal purse\nOf Beggar—or of Bird—\nOf small and spicy Yards—\nIn hue—a mellow Dun—\nOf Sunshine—and of Sere—Composed—\nBut, principally—of Sun—\nThe Wind—unrolled it fast—\nAnd spread it on the Ground—\nUpholsterer of the Pines—is He—\nUpholsterer—of the Pond—\n",
