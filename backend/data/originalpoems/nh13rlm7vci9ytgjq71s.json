  "poem": "Again-his voice is at the door-\nI feel the old Degree-\nI hear him ask the servant\nFor such an one-as me-\nI take a flower-as I go-\nMy face to justify-\nHe never saw me-in this life-\nI might surprise his eye!\nI cross the Hall with mingled steps-\nI-silent-pass the door-\nI look on all this world contains-\nJust his face-nothing more!\nWe talk in careless-and it toss-\nA kind of plummet strain-\nEach-sounding-shyly-\nJust-how-deep-\nThe other's one-had been-\nWe walk-I leave my Dog-at home-\nA tender-thoughtful Moon-\nGoes with us-just a little way-\nAnd-then-we are alone-\nAlone-if Angels are \"alone\"-\nFirst time they try the sky!\nAlone-if those \"veiled faces\"-be-\nWe cannot count-on High!\nI'd give-to live that hour-again-\nThe purple-in my Vein-\nBut He must count the drops-himself-\nMy price for every stain!\n",
