  "poem": "Years I had been from home,\nAnd now, before the door\nI dared not open, lest a face\nI never saw before\nStare vacant into mine\nAnd ask my business there.\nMy business, - just a life I left,\nWas such still dwelling there?\nI fumbled at my nerve,\nI scanned the windows near;\nThe silence like an ocean rolled,\nAnd broke against my ear.\nI laughed a wooden laugh\nThat I could fear a door,\nWho danger and the dead had faced,\nBut never quaked before.\nI fitted to the latch\nMy hand, with trembling care,\nLest back the awful door should spring,\nAnd leave me standing there.\nI moved my fingers off\nAs cautiously as glass,\nAnd held my ears, and like a thief\nFled gasping from the house.\n",
