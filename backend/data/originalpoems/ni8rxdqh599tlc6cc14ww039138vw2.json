  "poem": "There's something quieter than sleep\nWithin this inner room!\nIt wears a sprig upon its breast-\nAnd will not tell its name.\nSome touch it, and some kiss it-\nSome chafe its idle hand-\nIt has a simple gravity\nI do not understand!\nI would not weep if I were they-\nHow rude in one to sob!\nMight scare the quiet fairy\nBack to her native wood!\nWhile simple-hearted neighbors\nChat of the \"Early dead\"-\nWe-prone to periphrasis\nRemark that Birds have fled!\n",
