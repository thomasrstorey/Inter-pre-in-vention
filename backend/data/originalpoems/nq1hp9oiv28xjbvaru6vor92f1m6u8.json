  "poem": "Many a phrase has the English language-\nI have heard but one-\nLow as the laughter of the Cricket,\nLoud, as the Thunder's Tongue-\nMurmuring, like old Caspian Choirs,\nWhen the Tide's a' lull-\nSaying itself in new infection-\nLike a Whippoorwill-\nBreaking in bright Orthography\nOn my simple sleep-\nThundering its Prospective-\nTill I stir, and weep-\nNot for the Sorrow, done me-\nBut the push of Joy-\nSay it again, Saxton!\nHush-Only to me!\n",
