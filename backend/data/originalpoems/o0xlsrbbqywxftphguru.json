  "poem": "I know some lonely Houses off the Road\nA Robber'd like the look of-\nWooden barred,\nAnd Windows hanging low,\nInviting to-\nA Portico,\nWhere two could creep-\nOne-hand the Tools-\nThe other peep-\nTo make sure All's Asleep-\nOld fashioned eyes-\nNot easy to surprise!\nHow orderly the Kitchen'd look, by night,\nWith just a Clock-\nBut they could gag the Tick-\nAnd Mice won't bark-\nAnd so the Walls-don't tell-\nNone-will-\nA pair of Spectacles ajar just stir-\nAn Almanac's aware-\nWas it the Mat-winked,\nOr a Nervous Star?\nThe Moon-slides down the stair,\nTo see who's there!\nThere's plunder-where-\nTankard, or Spoon-\nEarring-or Stone-\nA Watch-Some Ancient Brooch\nTo match the Grandmama-\nStaid sleeping-there-\nDay-rattles-too\nStealth's-slow-\nThe Sun has got as far\nAs the third Sycamore-\nScreams Chanticleer\n\"Who's there\"?\nAnd Echoes-Trains away,\nSneer-\"Where\"!\nWhile the old Couple, just astir,\nFancy the Sunrise-left the door ajar!\n",
