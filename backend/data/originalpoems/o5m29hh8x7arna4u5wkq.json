  "poem": "My Faith is larger than the Hills-\nSo when the Hills decay-\nMy Faith must take the Purple Wheel\nTo show the Sun the way-\n'Tis first He steps upon the Vane-\nAnd then-upon the Hill-\nAnd then abroad the World He go\nTo do His Golden Will-\nAnd if His Yellow feet should miss-\nThe Bird would not arise-\nThe Flowers would slumber on their Stems-\nNo Bells have Paradise-\nHow dare I, therefore, stint a faith\nOn which so vast depends-\nLest Firmament should fail for me-\nThe Rivet in the Bands\n",
