  "poem": "The spider holds a Silver Ball\nIn unperceived Hands--\nAnd dancing softly to Himself\nHis Yarn of Pearl--unwinds--\nHe plies from Nought to Nought--\nIn unsubstantial Trade--\nSupplants our Tapestries with His--\nIn half the period--\nAn Hour to rear supreme\nHis Continents of Light--\nThen dangle from the Housewife's Broom--\nHis Boundaries--forgot--\n",
