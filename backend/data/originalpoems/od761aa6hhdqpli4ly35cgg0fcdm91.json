  "poem": "'T was just this time last year I died.\nI know I heard the corn,\nWhen I was carried by the farms,--\nIt had the tassels on.\nI thought how yellow it would look\nWhen Richard went to mill;\nAnd then I wanted to get out,\nBut something held my will.\nI thought just how red apples wedged\nThe stubble's joints between;\nAnd carts went stooping round the fields\nTo take the pumpkins in.\nI wondered which would miss me least,\nAnd when Thanksgiving came,\nIf father'd multiply the plates\nTo make an even sum.\nAnd if my stocking hung too high,\nWould it blur the Christmas glee,\nThat not a Santa Claus could reach\nThe altitude of me?\nBut this sort grieved myself, and so\nI thought how it would be\nWhen just this time, some perfect year,\nThemselves should come to me.\n",
