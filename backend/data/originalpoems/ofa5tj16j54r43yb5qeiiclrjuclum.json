  "poem": "She bore it till the simple veins\nTraced azure on her hand-\nTil pleading, round her quiet eyes\nThe purple Crayons stand.\nTill Daffodils had come and gone\nI cannot tell the sum,\nAnd then she ceased to bear it-\nAnd with the Saints sat down.\nNo more her patient figure\nAt twilight soft to meet-\nNo more her timid bonnet\nUpon the village street-\nBut Crowns instead, and Courtiers-\nAnd in the midst so fair,\nWhose but her shy-immortal face\nOf whom we're whispering here?\n",
