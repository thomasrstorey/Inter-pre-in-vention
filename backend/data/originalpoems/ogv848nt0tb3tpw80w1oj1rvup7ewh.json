  "poem": "I met a King this afternoon!\nHe had not on a Crown indeed,\nA little Palmleaf Hat was all,\nAnd he was barefoot, I'm afraid!\nBut sure I am he Ermine wore\nBeneath his faded Jacket's blue-\nAnd sure I am, the crest he bore\nWithin that Jacket's pocket too!\nFor 'twas too stately for an Earl-\nA Marquis would not go so grand!\n'Twas possibly a Czar petite-\nA Pope, or something of that kind!\nIf I must tell you, of a Horse\nMy freckled Monarch held the rein-\nDoubtless an estimable Beast,\nBut not at all disposed to run!\nAnd such a wagon! While I live\nDare I presume to see\nAnother such a vehicle\nAs then transported me!\nTwo other ragged Princes\nHis royal state partook!\nDoubtless the first excursion\nThese sovereigns ever took!\nI question if the Royal Coach\nRound which the Footmen wait\nHas the significance, on high,\nOf this Barefoot Estate!\n",
