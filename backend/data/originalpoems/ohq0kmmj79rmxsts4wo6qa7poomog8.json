  "poem": "Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,\nUnwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!\nOh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,\nFor sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.\nAll things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,\nGod hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!\nThe bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,\nAdam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;\nThe life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,\nWho will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.\nThe high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,\nNone cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;\nThe bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,\nAnd they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;\nThe wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,\nAnd the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.\nThe storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,\nThe wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,\nTheir spirits meet together, they make their solemn vows,\nNo more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.\nThe worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,\nNight unto day is married, morn unto eventide;\nEarth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,\nAnd Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.\nNow to the application, to the reading of the roll,\nTo bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul:\nThou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,\nWilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.\nHast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,\nAnd a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?\nThere's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,\nAnd Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!\nThine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see\nSix true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;\nApproach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,\nAnd seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!\nThen bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,\nAnd give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower-\nAnd bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum-\nAnd bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!\n",
