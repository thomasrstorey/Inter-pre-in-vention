  "poem": "I heard a fly buzz when I died;\nThe stillness round my form\nWas like the stillness in the air\nBetween the heaves of storm.\nThe eyes beside had wrung them dry,\nAnd breaths were gathering sure\nFor that last onset, when the king\nBe witnessed in his power.\nI willed my keepsakes, signed away\nWhat portion of me I\nCould make assignable, -- and then\nThere interposed a fly,\nWith blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,\nBetween the light and me;\nAnd then the windows failed, and then\nI could not see to see.\n",
