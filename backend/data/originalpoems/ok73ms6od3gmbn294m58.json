  "poem": "There's a certain Slant of light,\nWinter Afternoons--\nThat oppresses, like the Heft\nOf Cathedral Tunes--\nHeavenly Hurt, it gives us--\nWe can find no scar,\nBut internal difference,\nWhere the Meanings, are--\nNone may teach it--Any--\n'Tis the Seal Despair--\nAn imperial affliction\nSent us of the air--\nWhen it comes, the Landscape listens--\nShadows--hold their breath--\nWhen it goes, 'tis like the Distance\nOn the look of Death--\n",
