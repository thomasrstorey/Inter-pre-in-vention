  "poem": "I often passed the village\nWhen going home from school-\nAnd wondered what they did there-\nAnd why it was so still-\nI did not know the year then-\nIn which my call would come-\nEarlier, by the Dial,\nThan the rest have gone.\nIt's stiller than the sundown.\nIt's cooler than the dawn-\nThe Daisies dare to come here-\nAnd birds can flutter down-\nSo when you are tired-\nOr perplexed-or cold-\nTrust the loving promise\nUnderneath the mould,\nCry \"it's I,\" \"take Dollie,\"\nAnd I will enfold!\n",
