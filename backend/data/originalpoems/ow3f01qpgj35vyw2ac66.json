  "poem": "The Soul has Bandaged moments-\nWhen too appalled to stir-\nShe feels some ghastly Fright come up\nAnd stop to look at her-\nSalute her-with long fingers-\nCaress her freezing hair-\nSip, Goblin, from the very lips\nThe Lover-hovered-o'er-\nUnworthy, that a thought so mean\nAccost a Theme-so-fair-\nThe soul has moments of Escape-\nWhen bursting all the doors-\nShe dances like a Bomb, abroad,\nAnd swings upon the Hours,\nAs do the Bee-delirious borne-\nLong Dungeoned from his Rose-\nTouch Liberty-then know no more,\nBut Noon, and Paradise-\nThe Soul's retaken moments-\nWhen, Felon led along,\nWith shackles on the plumed feet,\nAnd staples, in the Song,\nThe Horror welcomes her, again,\nThese, are not brayed of Tongue-\n",
