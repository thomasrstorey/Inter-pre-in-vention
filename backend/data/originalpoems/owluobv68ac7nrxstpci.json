  "poem": "Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead\nCame the Darker Way-\nCarriages-Be Sure-and Guests-too-\nBut for Holiday\n'Tis more pitiful Endeavor\nThan did Loaded Sea\nO'er the Curls attempt to caper\nIt had cast away-\nNever Bride had such Assembling-\nNever kinsmen kneeled\nTo salute so fair a Forehead-\nGarland be indeed-\nFitter Feet-of Her before us-\nThan whatever Brow\nArt of Snow-or Trick of Lily\nPossibly bestow\nOf Her Father-Whoso ask Her-\nHe shall seek as high\nAs the Palm-that serve the Desert-\nTo obtain the Sky-\nDistance-be Her only Motion-\nIf 'tis Nay-or Yes-\nAcquiescence-or Demurral-\nWhosoever guess-\nHe-must pass the Crystal Angle\nThat obscure Her face-\nHe-must have achieved in person\nEqual Paradise-\n",
