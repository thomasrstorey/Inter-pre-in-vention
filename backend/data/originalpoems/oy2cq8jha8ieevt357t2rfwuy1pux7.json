  "poem": "She sweeps with many-colored brooms,\nAnd leaves the shreds behind;\nOh, housewife in the evening west,\nCome back, and dust the pond!\nYou dropped a purple ravelling in,\nYou dropped an amber thread;\nAnd now you've littered all the East\nWith duds of emerald!\nAnd still she plies her spotted brooms,\nAnd still the aprons fly,\nTill brooms fade softly into stars --\nAnd then I come away.\n",
