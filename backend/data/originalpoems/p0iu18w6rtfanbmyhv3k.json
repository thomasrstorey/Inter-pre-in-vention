  "poem": "In Winter in my Room\nI came upon a Worm-\nPink, lank and warm-\nBut as he was a worm\nAnd worms presume\nNot quite with him at home-\nSecured him by a string\nTo something neighboring\nAnd went along.\nA Trifle afterward\nA thing occurred\nI'd not believe it if I heard\nBut state with creeping blood-\nA snake with mottles rare\nSurveyed my chamber floor\nIn feature as the worm before\nBut ringed with power-\nThe very string with which\nI tied him-too\nWhen he was mean and new\nThat string was there-\nI shrank-\"How fair you are\"!\nPropitiation's claw-\n\"Afraid,\" he hissed\n\"Of me\"?\n\"No cordiality\"-\nHe fathomed me-\nThen to a Rhythm Slim\nSecreted in his Form\nAs Patterns swim\nProjected him.\nThat time I flew\nBoth eyes his way\nLest he pursue\nNor ever ceased to run\nTill in a distant Town\nTowns on from mine\nI set me down\nThis was a dream.\n",
