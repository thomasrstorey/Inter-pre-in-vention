  "poem": "There is a morn by men unseen-\nWhose maids upon remoter green\nKeep their Seraphic May-\nAnd all day long, with dance and game,\nAnd gambol I may never name-\nEmploy their holiday.\nHere to light measure, move the feet\nWhich walk no more the village street-\nNor by the wood are found-\nHere are the birds that sought the sun\nWhen last year's distaff idle hung\nAnd summer's brows were bound.\nNe'er saw I such a wondrous scene-\nNe'er such a ring on such a green-\nNor so serene array-\nAs if the stars some summer night\nShould swing their cups of Chrysolite-\nAnd revel till the day-\nLike thee to dance-like thee to sing-\nPeople upon the mystic green-\nI ask, each new May Morn.\nI wait thy far, fantastic bells-\nUnto the different dawn!\n",
