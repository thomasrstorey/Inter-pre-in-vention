  "poem": "That after Horror—that 'twas us—\nThat passed the mouldering Pier—\nJust as the Granite Crumb let go—\nOur Savior, by a Hair—\nA second more, had dropped too deep\nFor Fisherman to plumb—\nThe very profile of the Thought\nPuts Recollection numb—\nThe possibility—to pass\nWithout a Moment's Bell—\nInto Conjecture's presence—\nIs like a Face of Steel—\nThat suddenly looks into ours\nWith a metallic grin—\nThe Cordiality of Death—\nWho drills his Welcome in—\n",
