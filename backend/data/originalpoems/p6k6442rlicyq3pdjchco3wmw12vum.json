  "poem": "Precious to Me—She still shall be—\nThough She forget the name I bear—\nThe fashion of the Gown I wear—\nThe very Color of My Hair—\nSo like the Meadows—now—\nI dared to show a Tress of Theirs\nIf haply—She might not despise\nA Buttercup's Array—\nI know the Whole—obscures the Part—\nThe fraction—that appeased the Heart\nTill Number's Empery—\nRemembered—as the Millner's flower\nWhen Summer's Everlasting Dower—\nConfronts the dazzled Bee.\n",
