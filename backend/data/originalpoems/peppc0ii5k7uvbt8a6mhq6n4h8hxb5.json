  "poem": "From Cocoon forth a Butterfly\nAs Lady from her Door\nEmerged-a Summer Afternoon-\nRepairing Everywhere-\nWithout Design-that I could trace\nExcept to stray abroad\nOn Miscellaneous Enterprise\nThe Clovers-understood-\nHer pretty Parasol be seen\nContracting in a Field\nWhere Men made Hay-\nThen struggling hard\nWith an opposing Cloud-\nWhere Parties-Phantom as Herself-\nTo Nowhere-seemed to go\nIn purposeless Circumference-\nAs 'twere a Tropic Show-\nAnd notwithstanding Bee-that worked-\nAnd Flower-that zealous blew-\nThis Audience of Idleness\nDisdained them, from the Sky-\nTill Sundown crept-a steady Tide-\nAnd Men that made the Hay-\nAnd Afternoon-and Butterfly-\nExtinguished-in the Sea-\n",
