  "poem": "Joy to have merited the Pain-\nTo merit the Release-\nJoy to have perished every step-\nTo Compass Paradise-\nPardon-to look upon thy face-\nWith these old fashioned Eyes-\nBetter than new-could be-for that-\nThough bought in Paradise-\nBecause they looked on thee before-\nAnd thou hast looked on them-\nProve Me-My Hazel Witnesses\nThe features are the same-\nSo fleet thou wert, when present-\nSo infinite-when gone-\nAn Orient's Apparition-\nRemanded of the Morn-\nThe Height I recollect-\n'Twas even with the Hills-\nThe Depth upon my Soul was notched-\nAs Floods-on Whites of Wheels-\nTo Haunt-till Time have dropped\nHis last Decade away,\nAnd Haunting actualize-to last\nAt least-Eternity-\n",
