  "poem": "How many times these low feet staggered-\nOnly the soldered mouth can tell-\nTry-can you stir the awful rivet-\nTry-can you lift the hasps of steel!\nStroke the cool forehead-hot so often-\nLift-if you care-the listless hair-\nHandle the adamantine fingers\nNever a thimble-more-shall wear-\nBuzz the dull flies-on the chamber window-\nBrave-shines the sun through the freckled pane-\nFearless-the cobweb swings from the ceiling-\nIndolent Housewife-in Daisies-lain!\n",
