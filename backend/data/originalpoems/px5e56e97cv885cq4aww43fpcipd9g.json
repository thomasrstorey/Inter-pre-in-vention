  "poem": "No Man can compass a Despair-\nAs round a Goalless Road\nNo faster than a Mile at once\nThe Traveller proceed-\nUnconscious of the Width-\nUnconscious that the Sun\nBe setting on His progress-\nSo accurate the One\nAt estimating Pain-\nWhose own-has just begun-\nHis ignorance-the Angel\nThat pilot Him along-\n",
