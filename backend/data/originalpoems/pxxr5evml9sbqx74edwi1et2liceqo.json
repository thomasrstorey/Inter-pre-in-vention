  "poem": "The Birds reported from the South-\nA News express to Me-\nA spicy Charge, My little Posts-\nBut I am deaf-Today-\nThe Flowers-appealed-a timid Throng-\nI reinforced the Door-\nGo blossom for the Bees-I said-\nAnd trouble Me-no More-\nThe Summer Grace, for Notice strove-\nRemote-Her best Array-\nThe Heart-to stimulate the Eye\nRefused too utterly-\nAt length, a Mourner, like Myself,\nShe drew away austere-\nHer frosts to ponder-then it was\nI recollected Her-\nShe suffered Me, for I had mourned-\nI offered Her no word-\nMy Witness-was the Crape I bore-\nHer-Witness-was Her Dead-\nThenceforward-We-together dwelt-\nI never questioned Her-\nOur Contract\nA Wiser Sympathy\n",
