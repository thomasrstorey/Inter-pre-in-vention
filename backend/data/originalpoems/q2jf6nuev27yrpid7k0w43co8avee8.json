  "poem": "The Birds begun at Four o'clock-\nTheir period for Dawn-\nA Music numerous as space-\nBut neighboring as Noon-\nI could not count their Force-\nTheir Voices did expend\nAs Brook by Brook bestows itself\nTo multiply the Pond.\nTheir Witnesses were not-\nExcept occasional man-\nIn homely industry arrayed-\nTo overtake the Morn-\nNor was it for applause-\nThat I could ascertain-\nBut independent Ecstasy\nOf Deity and Men-\nBy Six, the Flood had done-\nNo Tumult there had been\nOf Dressing, or Departure-\nAnd yet the Band was gone-\nThe Sun engrossed the East-\nThe Day controlled the World-\nThe Miracle that introduced\nForgotten, as fulfilled.\n",
