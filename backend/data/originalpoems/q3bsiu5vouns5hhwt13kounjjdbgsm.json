  "poem": "This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life\nI mention it to you,\nWhen Sunrise through a fissure drop\nThe Day must follow too.\nIf we demur, its gaping sides\nDisclose as 'twere a Tomb\nOurself am lying straight wherein\nThe Favorite of Doom.\nWhen it has just contained a Life\nThen, Darling, it will close\nAnd yet so bolder every Day\nSo turbulent it grows\nI'm tempted half to stitch it up\nWith a remaining Breath\nI should not miss in yielding, though\nTo Him, it would be Death-\nAnd so I bear it big about\nMy Burial-before\nA Life quite ready to depart\nCan harass me no more-\n",
