  "poem": "By my Window have I for Scenery\nJust a Sea-with a Stem-\nIf the Bird and the Farmer-deem it a \"Pine\"-\nThe Opinion will serve-for them-\nIt has no Port, nor a \"Line\"-but the Jays-\nThat split their route to the Sky-\nOr a Squirrel, whose giddy Peninsula\nMay be easier reached-this way-\nFor Inlands-the Earth is the under side-\nAnd the upper side-is the Sun-\nAnd its Commerce-if Commerce it have-\nOf Spice-I infer from the Odors borne-\nOf its Voice-to affirm-when the Wind is within-\nCan the Dumb-define the Divine?\nThe Definition of Melody-is-\nThat Definition is none-\nIt-suggests to our Faith-\nThey-suggest to our Sight-\nWhen the latter-is put away\nI shall meet with Conviction I somewhere met\nThat Immortality-\nWas the Pine at my Window a \"Fellow\nOf the Royal\" Infinity?\nApprehensions-are God's introductions-\nTo be hallowed-accordingly-\n",
