  "poem": "The Daisy follows soft the Sun-\nAnd when his golden walk is done-\nSits shyly at his feet-\nHe-waking-finds the flower there-\nWherefore-Marauder-art thou here?\nBecause, Sir, love is sweet!\nWe are the Flower-Thou the Sun!\nForgive us, if as days decline-\nWe nearer steal to Thee!\nEnamored of the parting West-\nThe peace-the flight-the Amethyst-\nNight's possibility!\n",
