  "poem": "Me prove it now—Whoever doubt\nMe stop to prove it—now—\nMake haste—the Scruple! Death be scant\nFor Opportunity—\nThe River reaches to my feet—\nAs yet—My Heart be dry—\nOh Lover—Life could not convince—\nMight Death—enable Thee—\nThe River reaches to My Breast—\nStill—still—My Hands above\nProclaim with their remaining Might—\nDost recognize the Love?\nThe River reaches to my Mouth—\nRemember—when the Sea\nSwept by my searching eyes—the last—\nThemselves were quick—with Thee!\n",
