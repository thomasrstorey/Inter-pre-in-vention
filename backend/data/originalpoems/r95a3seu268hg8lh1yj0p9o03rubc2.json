  "poem": "On such a night, or such a night,\nWould anybody care\nIf such a little figure\nSlipped quiet from its chair-\nSo quiet-Oh how quiet,\nThat nobody might know\nBut that the little figure\nRocked softer-to and fro-\nOn such a dawn, or such a dawn-\nWould anybody sigh\nThat such a little figure\nToo sound asleep did lie\nFor Chanticleer to wake it-\nOr stirring house below-\nOr giddy bird in orchard-\nOr early task to do?\nThere was a little figure plump\nFor every little knoll-\nBusy needles, and spools of thread-\nAnd trudging feet from school-\nPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts-\nAnd visions vast and small-\nStrange that the feet so precious charged\nShould reach so small a goal!\n",
