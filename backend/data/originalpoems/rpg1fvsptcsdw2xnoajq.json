  "poem": "Severer Service of myself\nI-hastened to demand\nTo fill the awful Vacuum\nYour life had left behind-\nI worried Nature with my Wheels\nWhen Hers had ceased to run-\nWhen she had put away Her Work\nMy own had just begun.\nI strove to weary Brain and Bone-\nTo harass to fatigue\nThe glittering Retinue of nerves-\nVitality to clog\nTo some dull comfort Those obtain\nWho put a Head away\nThey knew the Hair to-\nAnd forget the color of the Day-\nAffliction would not be appeased-\nThe Darkness braced as firm\nAs all my stratagem had been\nThe Midnight to confirm-\nNo Drug for Consciousness-can be-\nAlternative to die\nIs Nature's only Pharmacy\nFor Being's Malady-\n",
