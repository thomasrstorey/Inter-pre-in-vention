  "poem": "If I may have it, when it's dead,\nI'll be contented-so-\nIf just as soon as Breath is out\nIt shall belong to me-\nUntil they lock it in the Grave,\n'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh-\nFor tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,\nMyself-can own the key-\nThink of it Lover! I and Thee\nPermitted-face to face to be-\nAfter a Life-a Death-We'll say-\nFor Death was That-\nAnd this-is Thee-\nI'll tell Thee All-how Bald it grew-\nHow Midnight felt, at first-to me-\nHow all the Clocks stopped in the World-\nAnd Sunshine pinched me-'Twas so cold-\nThen how the Grief got sleepy-some-\nAs if my Soul were deaf and dumb-\nJust making signs-across-to Thee-\nThat this way-thou could'st notice me-\nI'll tell you how I tried to keep\nA smile, to show you, when this Deep\nAll Waded-We look back for Play,\nAt those Old Times-in Calvary,\nForgive me, if the Grave come slow-\nFor Coveting to look at Thee-\nForgive me, if to stroke thy frost\nOutvisions Paradise!\n",
