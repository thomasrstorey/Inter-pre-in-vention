  "poem": "To know just how He suffered-would be dear-\nTo know if any Human eyes were near\nTo whom He could entrust His wavering gaze-\nUntil it settle broad-on Paradise-\nTo know if He was patient-part content-\nWas Dying as He thought-or different-\nWas it a pleasant Day to die-\nAnd did the Sunshine face his way-\nWhat was His furthest mind-Of Home-or God-\nOr what the Distant say-\nAt news that He ceased Human Nature\nSuch a Day-\nAnd Wishes-Had He Any-\nJust His Sigh-Accented-\nHad been legible-to Me-\nAnd was He Confident until\nIll fluttered out-in Everlasting Well-\nAnd if He spoke-What name was Best-\nWhat last\nWhat One broke off with\nAt the Drowsiest-\nWas He afraid-or tranquil-\nMight He know\nHow Conscious Consciousness-could grow-\nTill Love that was-and Love too best to be-\nMeet-and the Junction be Eternity\n",
