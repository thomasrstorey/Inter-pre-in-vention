  "poem": "A loss of something ever felt I-\nThe first that I could recollect\nBereft I was-of what I knew not\nToo young that any should suspect\nA Mourner walked among the children\nI notwithstanding went about\nAs one bemoaning a Dominion\nItself the only Prince cast out-\nElder, Today, a session wiser\nAnd fainter, too, as Wiseness is-\nI find myself still softly searching\nFor my Delinguent Palaces-\nAnd a Suspicion, like a Finger\nTouches my Forehead now and then\nThat I am looking oppositely\nFor the site of the Kingdom of Heaven-\n",
