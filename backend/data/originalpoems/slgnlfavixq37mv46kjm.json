  "poem": "My life had stood--a Loaded Gun--\nIn Corners--till a Day\nThe Owner passed--identified--\nAnd carried Me away--\nAnd now We roam in Sovereign Woods--\nAnd now We hunt the Doe--\nAnd every time I speak for Him--\nThe Mountains straight reply--\nAnd do I smile, such cordial light\nUpon the Valley glow--\nIt is as a Vesuvian face\nHad let its pleasure through--\nAnd when at Night--Our good Day done--\nI guard My Master's Head--\n'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's\nDeep Pillow--to have shared--\nTo foe of His--I'm deadly foe--\nNone stir the second time--\nOn whom I lay a Yellow Eye--\nOr an emphatic Thumb--\nThough I than He--may longer live\nHe longer must--than I--\nFor I have but the power to kill,\nWithout--the power to die--\n",
