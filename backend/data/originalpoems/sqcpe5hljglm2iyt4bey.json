  "poem": "Some Rainbow—coming from the Fair!\nSome Vision of the World Cashmere—\nI confidently see!\nOr else a Peacock's purple Train\nFeather by feather—on the plain\nFritters itself away!\nThe dreamy Butterflies bestir!\nLethargic pools resume the whir\nOf last year's sundered tune!\nFrom some old Fortress on the sun\nBaronial Bees—march—one by one—\nIn murmuring platoon!\nThe Robins stand as thick today\nAs flakes of snow stood yesterday—\nOn fence—and Roof—and Twig!\nThe Orchis binds her feather on\nFor her old lover - Don the Sun!\nRevisiting the Bog!\nWithout Commander! Countless! Still!\nThe Regiments of Wood and Hill\nIn bright detachment stand!\nBehold! Whose Multitudes are these?\nThe children of whose turbaned seas—\nOr what Circassian Land?\n",
