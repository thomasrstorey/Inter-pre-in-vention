  "poem": "Have you got a Brook in your little heart,\nWhere bashful flowers blow,\nAnd blushing birds go down to drink,\nAnd shadows tremble so-\nAnd nobody knows, so still it flows,\nThat any brook is there,\nAnd yet your little draught of life\nIs daily drunken there-\nWhy, look out for the little brook in March,\nWhen the rivers overflow,\nAnd the snows come hurrying from the fills,\nAnd the bridges often go-\nAnd later, in August it may be-\nWhen the meadows parching lie,\nBeware, lest this little brook of life,\nSome burning noon go dry!\n",
