  "poem": "The last Night that She lived\nIt was a Common Night\nExcept the Dying-this to Us\nMade Nature different\nWe noticed smallest things-\nThings overlooked before\nBy this great light upon our Minds\nItalicized-as 'twere.\nAs We went out and in\nBetween Her final Room\nAnd Rooms where Those to be alive\nTomorrow were, a Blame\nThat Others could exist\nWhile She must finish quite\nA Jealousy for Her arose\nSo nearly infinite-\nWe waited while She passed-\nIt was a narrow time-\nToo jostled were Our Souls to speak\nAt length the notice came.\nShe mentioned, and forgot-\nThen lightly as a Reed\nBent to the Water, struggled scarce-\nConsented, and was dead-\nAnd We-We placed the Hair-\nAnd drew the Head erect-\nAnd then an awful leisure was\nBelief to regulate-\n",
