  "poem": "The Winters are so short-\nI'm hardly justified\nIn sending all the Birds away-\nAnd moving into Pod-\nMyself-for scarcely settled-\nThe Phoebes have begun-\nAnd then-it's time to strike my Tent-\nAnd open House-again-\nIt's mostly, interruptions-\nMy Summer-is despoiled-\nBecause there was a Winter-once-\nAnd al the Cattle-starved-\nAnd so there was a Deluge-\nAnd swept the World away-\nBut Ararat's a Legend-now-\nAnd no one credits Noah-\n",
