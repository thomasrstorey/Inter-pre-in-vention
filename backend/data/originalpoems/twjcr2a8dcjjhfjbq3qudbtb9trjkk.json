  "poem": "The Heaven vests for Each\nIn that small Deity\nIt craved the grace to worship\nSome bashful Summer's Day-\nHalf shrinking from the Glory\nIt importuned to see\nTill these faint Tabernacles drop\nIn full Eternity-\nHow imminent the Venture-\nAs one should sue a Star-\nFor His mean sake to leave the Row\nAnd entertain Despair-\nA Clemency so common-\nWe almost cease to fear-\nEnabling the minutest-\nAnd furthest-to adore-\n",
