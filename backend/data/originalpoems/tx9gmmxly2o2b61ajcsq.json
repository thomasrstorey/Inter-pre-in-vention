  "poem": "The day came slow, till five o'clock,\nThen sprang before the hills,\nLike hindered rubies, or the light,\nA sudden musket spills.\nThe purple could not keep the east.\nThe sunrise shook from fold.\nLike breadths of topaz, packed a night,\nThe lady just unrolled.\nThe happy winds their timbrels took;\nThe birds in docile rows,\nArranged themselves around their prince.\n(The wind is prince of those.)\nThe orchard sparkled like a Jew,---\nHow mighty 'twas to stay,\nA guest in this stupendous place,\nThe parlor of the day.\n",
