  "poem": "A poor-torn heart-a tattered heart-\nThat sat it down to rest-\nNor noticed that the Ebbing Day\nFlowed silver to the West-\nNor noticed Night did soft descend-\nNor Constellation burn-\nIntent upon the vision\nOf latitudes unknown.\nThe angels-happening that way\nThis dusty heart espied-\nTenderly took it up from toil\nAnd carried it to God-\nThere-sandals for the Barefoot-\nThere-gathered from the gales-\nDo the blue havens by the hand\nLead the wandering Sails.\n",
