  "poem": "The Gentian weaves her fringes-\nThe Maple's loom is red-\nMy departing blossoms\nObviate parade.\nA brief, but patient illness-\nAn hour to prepare,\nAnd one below this morning\nIs where the angels are-\nIt was a short procession,\nThe Bobolink was there-\nAn aged Bee addressed us-\nAnd then we knelt in prayer-\nWe trust that she was willing-\nWe ask that we may be.\nSummer-Sister-Seraph!\nLet us go with thee!\nIn the name of the Bee-\nAnd of the Butterfly-\nAnd of the Breeze-Amen!\n",
