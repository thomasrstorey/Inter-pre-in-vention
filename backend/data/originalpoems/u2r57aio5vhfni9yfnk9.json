Did Rose her Bee-\nFor Privilege of Play\nOr Wile of Butterfly\nOr Opportunity-Her Lord away?\nThe lady with the Amulet-will face-\nThe Bee-in Mausoleum laid-\nDiscard his Bride-\nBut longer than the little Rill-\nThat cooled the Forehead of the Hill-\nWhile Other-went the Sea to fill-\nAnd Other-went to turn the Mill-\nI'll do thy Will-\n",
