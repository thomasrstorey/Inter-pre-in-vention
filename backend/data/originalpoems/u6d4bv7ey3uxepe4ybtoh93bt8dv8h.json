  "poem": "I had no Cause to be awake-\nMy Best-was gone to sleep-\nAnd Morn a new politeness took-\nAnd failed to wake them up-\nBut called the others-clear-\nAnd passed their Curtains by-\nSweet Morning-when I oversleep-\nKnock-Recollect-to Me-\nI looked at Sunrise-Once-\nAnd then I looked at Them-\nAnd wishfulness in me arose-\nFor Circumstance the same-\n'Twas such an Ample Peace-\nIt could not hold a Sigh-\n'Twas Sabbath-with the Bells divorced-\n'Twas Sunset-all the Day-\nSo choosing but a Gown-\nAnd taking but a Prayer-\nThe only Raiment I should need-\nI struggled-and was There-\n",
