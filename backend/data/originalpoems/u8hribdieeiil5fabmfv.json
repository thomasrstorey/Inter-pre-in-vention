  "poem": "A Wife-at daybreak I shall be-\nSunrise-Hast thou a Flag for me?\nAt Midnight, I am but a Maid,\nHow short it takes to make a Bride-\nThen-Midnight, I have passed from thee\nUnto the East, and Victory-\nMidnight-Good Night! I hear them call,\nThe Angels bustle in the Hall-\nSoftly my Future climbs the Stair,\nI fumble at my Childhood's prayer\nSo soon to be a Child no more-\nEternity, I'm coming-Sire,\nSavior-I've seen the face-before!\n",
