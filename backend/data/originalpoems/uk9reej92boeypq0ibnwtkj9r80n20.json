  "poem": "I felt my life with both my hands\nTo see if it was there-\nI held my spirit to the Glass,\nTo prove it possibler-\nI turned my Being round and round\nAnd paused at every pound\nTo ask the Owner's name-\nFor doubt, that I should know the Sound-\nI judged my features-jarred my hair-\nI pushed my dimples by, and waited-\nIf they-twinkled back-\nConviction might, of me-\nI told myself, \"Take Courage, Friend-\nThat-was a former time-\nBut we might learn to like the Heaven,\nAs well as our Old Home!\"\n",
