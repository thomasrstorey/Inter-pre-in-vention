  "poem": "One Year ago—jots what?\nGod—spell the word! I—can't—\nWas't Grace? Not that—\nWas't Glory? That—will do—\nSpell slower—Glory—\nSuch Anniversary shall be—\nSometimes—not often—in Eternity—\nWhen farther Parted, than the Common Woe—\nLook—feed upon each other's faces—so—\nIn doubtful meal, if it be possible\nTheir Banquet's true—\nI tasted—careless—then—\nI did not know the Wine\nCame once a World—Did you?\nOh, had you told me so—\nThis Thirst would blister—easier—now—\nYou said it hurt you—most—\nMine—was an Acorn's Breast—\nAnd could not know how fondness grew\nIn Shaggier Vest—\nPerhaps—I couldn't—\nBut, had you looked in—\nA Giant—eye to eye with you, had been—\nNo Acorn—then—\nSo—Twelve months ago—\nWe breathed—\nThen dropped the Air—\nWhich bore it best?\nWas this—the patientest—\nBecause it was a Child, you know—\nAnd could not value—Air?\nIf to be \"Elder\"—mean most pain—\nI'm old enough, today, I'm certain—then—\nAs old as thee—how soon?\nOne—Birthday more—or Ten?\nLet me—choose!\nAh, Sir, None!\n",
