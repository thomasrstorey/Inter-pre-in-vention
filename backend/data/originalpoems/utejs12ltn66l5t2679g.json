  "poem": "The Heart has narrow Banks\nIt measures like the Sea\nIn mighty-unremitting Bass\nAnd Blue Monotony\nTill Hurricane bisect\nAnd as itself discerns\nIts sufficient Area\nThe Heart convulsive learns\nThat Calm is but a Wall\nOf unattempted Gauze\nAn instant's Push demolishes\nA Questioning-dissolves.\n",
