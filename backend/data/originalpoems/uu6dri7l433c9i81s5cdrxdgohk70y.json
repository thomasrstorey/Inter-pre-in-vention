  "poem": "He fumbles at your spirit\nAs players at the keys\nBefore they drop full music on;\nHe stuns you by degrees,\nPrepares your brittle substance\nFor the ethereal blow,\nBy fainter hammers, further heard,\nThen nearer, then so slow\nYour breath has time to straighten,\nYour brain to bubble cool, --\nDeals one imperial thunderbolt\nThat scalps your naked soul.\n",
