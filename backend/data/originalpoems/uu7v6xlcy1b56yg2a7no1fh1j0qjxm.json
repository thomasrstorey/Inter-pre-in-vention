  "poem": "The feet of people walking home\nWith gayer sandals go-\nThe Crocus- til she rises\nThe Vassal of the snow-\nThe lips at Hallelujah\nLong years of practise bore\nTil bye and bye these Bargemen\nWalked singing on the shore.\nPearls are the Diver's farthings\nExtorted from the Sea-\nPinions- the Seraph's wagon\nPedestrian once- as we-\nNight is the morning's Canvas\nLarceny- legacy-\nDeath, but our rapt attention\nTo Immortality.\nMy figures fail to tell me\nHow far the Village lies-\nWhose peasants are the Angels-\nWhose Cantons dot the skies-\nMy Classics veil their faces-\nMy faith that Dark adores-\nWhich from its solemn abbeys\nSuch ressurection pours.\n",
