  "poem": "'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch,\nThat nearer, every Day,\nKept narrowing its boiling Wheel\nUntil the Agony\nToyed coolly with the final inch\nOf your delirious Hem-\nAnd you dropt, lost,\nWhen something broke-\nAnd let you from a Dream-\nAs if a Goblin with a Gauge-\nKept measuring the Hours-\nUntil you felt your Second\nWeigh, helpless, in his Paws-\nAnd not a Sinew-stirred-could help,\nAnd sense was setting numb-\nWhen God-remembered-and the Fiend\nLet go, then, Overcome-\nAs if your Sentence stood-pronounced-\nAnd you were frozen led\nFrom Dungeon's luxury of Doubt\nTo Gibbets, and the Dead-\nAnd when the Film had stitched your eyes\nA Creature gasped \"Reprieve\"!\nWhich Anguish was the utterest-then-\nTo perish, or to live?\n",
