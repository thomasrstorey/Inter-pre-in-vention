  "poem": "I know where Wells grow—Droughtless Wells—\nDeep dug—for Summer days—\nWhere Mosses go no more away—\nAnd Pebble—safely plays—\nIt's made of Fathoms—and a Belt—\nA Belt of jagged Stone—\nInlaid with Emerald—half way down—\nAnd Diamonds—jumbled on—\nIt has no Bucket—Were I rich\nA Bucket I would buy—\nI'm often thirsty—but my lips\nAre so high up—You see—\nI read in an Old fashioned Book\nThat People \"thirst no more\"—\nThe Wells have Buckets to them there—\nIt must mean that—I'm sure—\nShall We remember Parching—then?\nThose Waters sound so grand—\nI think a little Well—like Mine—\nDearer to understand—\n",
