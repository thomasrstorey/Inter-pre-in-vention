  "poem": "A Prison gets to be a friend-\nBetween its Ponderous face\nAnd Ours-a Kinsmanship express-\nAnd in its narrow Eyes-\nWe come to look with gratitude\nFor the appointed Beam\nIt deal us-stated as our food-\nAnd hungered for-the same-\nWe learn to know the Planks-\nThat answer to Our feet-\nSo miserable a sound-at first-\nNor ever now-so sweet-\nAs plashing in the Pools-\nWhen Memory was a Boy-\nBut a Demurer Circuit-\nA Geometric Joy-\nThe Posture of the Key\nThat interrupt the Day\nTo Our Endeavor-Not so real\nThe Check of Liberty-\nAs this Phantasm Steel-\nWhose features-Day and Night-\nAre present to us-as Our Own-\nAnd as escapeless-quite-\nThe narrow Round-the Stint-\nThe slow exchange of Hope-\nFor something passiver-Content\nToo steep for lookinp up-\nThe Liberty we knew\nAvoided-like a Dream-\nToo wide for any Night but Heaven-\nIf That-indeed-redeem-\n",
