  "poem": "I was the slightest in the House-\nI took the smallest Room-\nAt night, my little Lamp, and Book-\nAnd one Geranium-\nSo stationed I could catch the Mint\nThat never ceased to fall-\nAnd just my Basket-\nLet me think-I'm sure-\nThat this was all-\nI never spoke-unless addressed-\nAnd then, 'twas brief and low-\nI could not bear to live-aloud-\nThe Racket shamed me so-\nAnd if it had not been so far-\nAnd any one I knew\nWere going-I had often thought\nHow noteless-I could die-\n",
