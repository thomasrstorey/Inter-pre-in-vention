  "poem": "The Fingers of the Light\nTapped soft upon the Town\nWith \"I am great and cannot wait\nSo therefore let me in.\"\n\"You're soon,\" the Town replied,\n\"My Faces are asleep-\nBut swear, and I will let you by,\nYou will not wake them up.\"\nThe easy Guest complied\nBut once within the Town\nThe transport of His Countenance\nAwakened Maid and Man\nThe Neighbor in the Pool\nUpon His Hip elate\nMade loud obeisance and the Gnat\nHeld up His Cup for Light.\n",
