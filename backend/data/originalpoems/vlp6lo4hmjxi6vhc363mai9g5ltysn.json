  "poem": "Taking up the fair Ideal,\nJust to cast her down\nWhen a fracture-we discover-\nOr a splintered Crown-\nMakes the Heavens portable-\nAnd the Gods-a lie-\nDoubtless-\"Adam\"-scowled at Eden-\nFor his perjury!\nCherishing-our pool Ideal-\nTill in purer dress-\nWe behold her-glorified-\nComforts-search-like this-\nTill the broken creatures-\nWe adored-for whole-\nStains-all washed-\nTransfigured-mended-\nMeet us-with a smile-\n",
