  "poem": "If I could bribe them by a Rose\nI'd bring them every flower that grows\nFrom Amherst to Cashmere!\nI would not stop for night, or storm-\nOr frost, or death, or anyone-\nMy business were so dear!\nIf they would linger for a Bird\nMy Tambourin were soonest heard\nAmong the April Woods!\nUnwearied, all the summer long,\nOnly to break in wilder song\nWhen Winter shook the boughs!\nWhat if they hear me!\nWho shall say\nThat such an importunity\nMay not at last avail?\nThat, weary of this Beggar's face-\nThey may not finally say, Yes-\nTo drive her from the Hall?\n",
