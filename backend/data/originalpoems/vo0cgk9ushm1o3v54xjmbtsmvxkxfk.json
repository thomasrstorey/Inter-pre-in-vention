  "poem": "He put the Belt around my life\nI heard the Buckle snap-\nAnd turned away, imperial,\nMy Lifetime folding up-\nDeliberate, as a Duke would do\nA Kingdom's Title Deed-\nHenceforth, a Dedicated sort-\nA Member of the Cloud.\nYet not too far to come at call-\nAnd do the little Toils\nThat make the Circuit of the Rest-\nAnd deal occasional smiles\nTo lives that stoop to notice mine-\nAnd kindly ask it in-\nWhose invitation, know you not\nFor Whom I must decline?\n",
