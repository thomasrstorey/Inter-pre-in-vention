  "poem": "Unto my Books—so good to turn—\nFar ends of tired Days—\nIt half endears the Abstinence—\nAnd Pain—is missed—in Praise—\nAs Flavors—cheer Retarded Guests\nWith Banquettings to be—\nSo Spices—stimulate the time\nTill my small Library—\nIt may be Wilderness—without—\nFar feet of failing Men—\nBut Holiday—excludes the night—\nAnd it is Bells—within—\nI thank these Kinsmen of the Shelf—\nTheir Countenances Kid\nEnamor—in Prospective—\nAnd satisfy—obtained—\n",
