  "poem": "Like trains of cars on tracks of plush\nI hear the level bee:\nA jar across the flowers goes,\nTheir velvet masonry\nWithstands until the sweet assault\nTheir chivalry consumes,\nWhile he, victorious, tilts away\nTo vanquish other blooms.\nHis feet are shod with gauze,\nHis helmet is of gold;\nHis breast, a single onyx\nWith chrysoprase, inlaid.\nHis labor is a chant,\nHis idleness a tune;\nOh, for a bee's experience\nOf clovers and of noon!\n",
