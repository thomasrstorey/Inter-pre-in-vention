  "poem": "I cannot dance upon my Toes-\nNo Man instructed me-\nBut oftentimes, among my mind,\nA Glee possesseth me,\nThat had I Ballet knowledge-\nWould put itself abroad\nIn Pirouette to blanch a Troupe-\nOr lay a Prima, mad,\nAnd though I had no Gown of Gauze-\nNo Ringlet, to my Hair,\nNor hopped to Audiences-like Birds,\nOne Claw upon the Air,\nNor tossed my shape in Eider Balls,\nNor rolled on wheels of snow\nTill I was out of sight, in sound,\nThe House encore me so-\nNor any know I know the Art\nI mention-easy-Here-\nNor any Placard boast me-\nIt's full as Opera-\n",
