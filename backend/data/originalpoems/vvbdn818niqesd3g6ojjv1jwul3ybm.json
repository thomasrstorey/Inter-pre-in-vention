  "poem": "A Tongue—to tell Him I am true!\nIts fee—to be of Gold—\nHad Nature—in Her monstrous House\nA single Ragged Child—\nTo earn a Mine—would run\nThat Interdicted Way,\nAnd tell Him—Charge thee speak it plain—\nThat so far—Truth is True?\nAnd answer What I do—\nBeginning with the Day\nThat Night—begun—\nNay—Midnight—'twas—\nSince Midnight—happened—say—\nIf once more—Pardon—Boy—\nThe Magnitude thou may\nEnlarge my Message—If too vast\nAnother Lad—help thee—\nThy Pay—in Diamonds—be—\nAnd His—in solid Gold—\nSay Rubies—if He hesitate—\nMy Message—must be told—\nSay—last I said—was This—\nThat when the Hills—come down—\nAnd hold no higher than the Plain—\nMy Bond—have just begun—\nAnd when the Heavens—disband—\nAnd Deity conclude—\nThen—look for me. Be sure you say—\nLeast Figure—on the Road—\n",
