  "poem": "The Night was wide, and furnished scant\nWith but a single Star-\nThat often as a Cloud it met-\nBlew out itself-for fear-\nThe Wind pursued the little Bush-\nAnd drove away the Leaves\nNovember left-then clambered up\nAnd fretted in the Eaves-\nNo Squirrel went abroad-\nA Dog's belated feet\nLike intermittent Plush, he heard\nAdown the empty Street-\nTo feel if Blinds be fast-\nAnd closer to the fire-\nHer little Rocking Chair to draw-\nAnd shiver for the Poor-\nThe Housewife's gentle Task-\nHow pleasanter-said she\nUnto the Sofa opposite-\nThe Sleet-than May, no Thee-\n",
