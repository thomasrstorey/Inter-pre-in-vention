  "poem": "A Lady red-amid the Hill\nHer annual secret keeps!\nA Lady white, within the Field\nIn placid Lily sleeps!\nThe tidy Breezes, with their Brooms-\nSweep vale-and hill-and tree!\nPrithee, My pretty Housewives!\nWho may expected be?\nThe Neighbors do not yet suspect!\nThe Woods exchange a smile!\nOrchard, and Buttercup, and Bird-\nIn such a little while!\nAnd yet, how still the Landscape stands!\nHow nonchalant the Hedge!\nAs if the \"Resurrection\"\nWere nothing very strange!\n",
