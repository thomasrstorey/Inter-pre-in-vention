  "poem": "It will be Summer—eventually.\nLadies—with parasols—\nSauntering Gentlemen—with Canes—\nAnd little Girls—with Dolls—\nWill tint the pallid landscape—\nAs 'twere a bright Bouquet—\nThro' drifted deep, in Parian—\nThe Village lies—today—\nThe Lilacs—bending many a year—\nWill sway with purple load—\nThe Bees—will not despise the tune—\nTheir Forefathers—have hummed—\nThe Wild Rose—redden in the Bog—\nThe Aster—on the Hill\nHer everlasting fashion—set—\nAnd Covenant Gentians—frill—\nTill Summer folds her miracle—\nAs Women—do—their Gown—\nOf Priests—adjust the Symbols—\nWhen Sacrament—is done—\n",
