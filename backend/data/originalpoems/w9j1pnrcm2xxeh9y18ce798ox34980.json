  "poem": "There's been a death in the opposite house\nAs lately as to-day.\nI know it by the numb look\nSuch houses have alway.\nThe neighbors rustle in and out,\nThe doctor drives away.\nA window opens like a pod,\nAbrupt, mechanically;\nSomebody flings a mattress out,--\nThe children hurry by;\nThey wonder if It died on that,--\nI used to when a boy.\nThe minister goes stiffly in\nAs if the house were his,\nAnd he owned all the mourners now,\nAnd little boys besides;\nAnd then the milliner, and the man\nOf the appalling trade,\nTo take the measure of the house.\nThere'll be that dark parade\nOf tassels and of coaches soon;\nIt's easy as a sign,--\nThe intuition of the news\nIn just a country town.\n",
