  "poem": "The Angle of a Landscape-\nThat every time I wake-\nBetween my Curtain and the Wall\nUpon an ample Crack-\nLike a Venetian-waiting-\nAccosts my open eye-\nIs just a Bough of Apples-\nHeld slanting, in the Sky-\nThe Pattern of a Chimney-\nThe Forehead of a Hill-\nSometimes-a Vane's Forefinger-\nBut that's-Occasional-\nThe Seasons-shift-my Picture-\nUpon my Emerald Bough,\nI wake-to find no-Emeralds-\nThen-Diamonds-which the Snow\nFrom Polar Caskets-fetched me-\nThe Chimney-and the Hill-\nAnd just the Steeple's finger-\nThese-never stir at all-\n",
