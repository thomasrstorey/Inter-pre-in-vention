  "poem": "It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon-\nThe Flower-distinct and Red-\nI, passing, thought another Noon\nAnother in its stead\nWill equal glow, and thought no More\nBut came another Day\nTo find the Species disappeared-\nThe Same Locality-\nThe Sun in place-no other fraud\nOn Nature's perfect Sum-\nHad I but lingered Yesterday-\nWas my retrieveless blame-\nMuch Flowers of this and further Zones\nHave perished in my Hands\nFor seeking its Resemblance-\nBut unapproached it stands-\nThe single Flower of the Earth\nThat I, in passing by\nUnconscious was-Great Nature's Face\nPassed infinite by Me-\n",
