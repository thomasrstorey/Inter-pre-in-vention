  "poem": "To die—takes just a little while—\nThey say it doesn't hurt—\nIt's only fainter—by degrees—\nAnd then—it's out of sight—\nA darker Ribbon—for a Day—\nA Crape upon the Hat—\nAnd then the pretty sunshine comes—\nAnd helps us to forget—\nThe absent—mystic—creature—\nThat but for love of us—\nHad gone to sleep—that soundest time—\nWithout the weariness—\n",
