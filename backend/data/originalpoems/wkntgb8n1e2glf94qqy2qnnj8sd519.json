  "poem": "The only ghost I ever saw\nWas dressed in mechlin, --so;\nHe wore no sandal on his foot,\nAnd stepped like flakes of snow.\nHis gait was soundless, like the bird,\nBut rapid, like the roe;\nHis fashions quaint, mosaic,\nOr, haply, mistletoe.\nHi conversation seldom,\nHis laughter like the breeze\nThat dies away in dimples\nAmong the pensive trees.\nOur interview was transient, --\nOf me, himself was shy;\nAnd God forbid I look behind\nSince that appalling day!\n",
