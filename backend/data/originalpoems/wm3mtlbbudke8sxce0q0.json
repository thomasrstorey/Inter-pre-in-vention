  "poem": "The Way I read a Letter's—this—\n'Tis first—I lock the Door—\nAnd push it with my fingers—next—\nFor transport it be sure—\nAnd then I go the furthest off\nTo counteract a knock—\nThen draw my little Letter forth\nAnd slowly pick the lock—\nThen—glancing narrow, at the Wall—\nAnd narrow at the floor\nFor firm Conviction of a Mouse\nNot exorcised before—\nPeruse how infinite I am\nTo no one that You—know—\nAnd sigh for lack of Heaven—but not\nThe Heaven God bestow—\n",
