  "poem": "One Blessing had I than the rest\nSo larger to my Eyes\nThat I stopped gauging-satisfied-\nFor this enchanted size-\nIt was the limit of my Dream-\nThe focus of my Prayer-\nA perfect-paralyzing Bliss-\nContented as Despair-\nI knew no more of Want-or Cold-\nPhantasms both become\nFor this new Value in the Soul-\nSupremest Earthly Sum-\nThe Heaven below the Heaven above-\nObscured with ruddier Blue-\nLife's Latitudes leant over-full-\nThe Judgment perished-too-\nWhy Bliss so scantily disburse-\nWhy Paradise defer-\nWhy Floods be served to Us-in Bowls-\nI speculate no more-\n",
