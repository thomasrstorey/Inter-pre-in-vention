  "poem": "Before the ice is in the pools-\nBefore the skaters go,\nOr any check at nightfall\nIs tarnished by the snow-\nBefore the fields have finished,\nBefore the Christmas tree,\nWonder upon wonder\nWill arrive to me!\nWhat we touch the hems of\nOn a summer's day-\nWhat is only walking\nJust a bridge away-\nThat which sings so-speaks so-\nWhen there's no one here-\nWill the frock I wept in\nAnswer me to wear?\n",
