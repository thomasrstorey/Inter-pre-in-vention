  "poem": "Although I put away his life-\nAn Ornament too grand\nFor Forehead low as mine, to wear,\nThis might have been the Hand\nThat sowed the flower, he preferred-\nOr smoothed a homely pain,\nOr pushed the pebble from his path-\nOr played his chosen tune-\nOn Lute the least-the latest-\nBut just his Ear could know\nThat whatsoe'er delighted it,\nI never would let go-\nThe foot to bear his errand-\nA little Boot I know-\nWould leap abroad like Antelope-\nWith just the grant to do-\nHis weariest Commandment-\nA sweeter to obey,\nThan \"Hide and Seek\"-\nOr skip to Flutes-\nOr all Day, chase the Bee-\nYour Servant, Sir, will weary-\nThe Surgeon, will not come-\nThe World, will have its own-to do-\nThe Dust, will vex your Fame-\nThe Cold will force your tightest door\nSome February Day,\nBut say my apron bring the sticks\nTo make your Cottage gay-\nThat I may take that promise\nTo Paradise, with me-\nTo teach the Angels, avarice,\nYou, Sir, taught first-to me.\n",
