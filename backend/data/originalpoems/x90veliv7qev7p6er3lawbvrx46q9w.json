  "poem": "I Came to buy a smile—today—\nBut just a single smile—\nThe smallest one upon your face\nWill suit me just as well—\nThe one that no one else would miss\nIt shone so very small—\nI'm pleading at the \"counter\"—sir—\nCould you afford to sell—\nI've Diamonds—on my fingers—\nYou know what Diamonds are?\nI've Rubies—live the Evening Blood—\nAnd Topaz—like the star!\n'Twould be \"a Bargain\" for a Jew!\nSay—may I have it—Sir?\n",
