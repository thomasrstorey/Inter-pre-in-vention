  "poem": "It was not death, for I stood up,\nAnd all the dead lie down;\nIt was not night, for all the bells\nPut out their tongues, for noon.\nIt was not frost, for on my flesh\nI felt siroccos crawl,--\nNor fire, for just my marble feet\nCould keep a chancel cool.\nAnd yet it tasted like them all;\nThe figures I have seen\nSet orderly, for burial,\nReminded me of mine,\nAs if my life were shaven\nAnd fitted to a frame,\nAnd could not breathe without a key;\nAnd 't was like midnight, some,\nWhen everything that ticked has stopped,\nAnd space stares, all around,\nOr grisly frosts, first autumn morns,\nRepeal the beating ground.\nBut most like chaos,--stopless, cool,--\nWithout a chance or spar,--\nOr even a report of land\nTo justify despair.\n",
