  "poem": "Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews,\nBut never deemed the dripping prize\nAwaited their-low Brows-\nOr Bees-that thought the Summer's name\nSome rumor of Delirium,\nNo Summer-could-for Them-\nOr Arctic Creatures, dimly stirred-\nBy Tropic Hint-some Travelled Bird\nImported to the Wood-\nOr Wind's bright signal to the Ear-\nMaking that homely, and severe,\nContented, known, before-\nThe Heaven-unexpected come,\nTo Lives that thought the Worshipping\nA too presumptuous Psalm-\n",
