  "poem": "He gave away his Life-\nTo Us-Gigantic Sum-\nA trifle-in his own esteem-\nBut magnified-by Fame-\nUntil it burst the Hearts\nThat fancied they could hold-\nWhen swift it slipped its limit-\nAnd on the Heavens-unrolled-\n'Tis Ours-to wince-and weep-\nAnd wonder-and decay\nBy Blossoms gradual process-\nHe chose-Maturity-\nAnd quickening-as we sowed-\nJust obviated Bud-\nAnd when We turned to note the Growth-\nBroke-perfect-from the Pod-\n",
