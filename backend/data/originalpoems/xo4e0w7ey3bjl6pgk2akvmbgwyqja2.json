  "poem": "The Morning after Woe-\n'Tis frequently the Way-\nSurpasses all that rose before-\nFor utter Jubilee-\nAs Nature did not care-\nAnd piled her Blossoms on-\nAnd further to parade a Joy\nHer Victim stared upon-\nThe Birds declaim their Tunes-\nPronouncing every word\nLike Hammers-Did they know they fell\nLike Litanies of Lead-\nOn here and there-a creature-\nThey'd modify the Glee\nTo fit some Crucifixal Clef-\nSome Key of Calvary-\n",
