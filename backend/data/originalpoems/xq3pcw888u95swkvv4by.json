  "poem": "Our little Kinsmen—after Rain\nIn plenty may be seen,\nA Pink and Pulpy multitude\nThe tepid Ground upon.\nA needless life, it seemed to me\nUntil a little Bird\nAs to a Hospitality\nAdvanced and breakfasted.\nAs I of He, so God of Me\nI pondered, may have judged,\nAnd left the little Angle Worm\nWith Modesties enlarged.\n",
