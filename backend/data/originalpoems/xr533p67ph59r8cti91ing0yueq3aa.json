  "poem": "'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!\nIf I should fail, what poverty!\nAnd yet, as poor as I,\nHave ventured all upon a throw!\nHave gained! Yes! Hesitated so-\nThis side the Victory!\nLife is but Life! And Death, but Death!\nBliss is, but Bliss, and Breath but Breath!\nAnd if indeed I fail,\nAt least, to know the worst, is sweet!\nDefeat means nothing but Defeat,\nNo drearier, can befall!\nAnd if I gain! Oh Gun at Sea!\nOh Bells, that in the Steeples be!\nAt first, repeat it slow!\nFor Heaven is a different thing,\nConjectured, and waked sudden in-\nAnd might extinguish me!\n",
