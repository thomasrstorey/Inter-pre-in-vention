  "poem": "I measure every Grief I meet\nWith narrow, probing, Eyes--\nI wonder if It weighs like Mine--\nOr has an Easier size.\nI wonder if They bore it long--\nOr did it just begin--\nI could not tell the Date of Mine--\nIt feels so old a pain--\nI wonder if it hurts to live--\nAnd if They have to try--\nAnd whether--could They choose between--\nIt would not be--to die--\nI note that Some--gone patient long--\nAt length, renew their smile--\nAn imitation of a Light\nThat has so little Oil--\nI wonder if when Years have piled--\nSome Thousands--on the Harm--\nThat hurt them early--such a lapse\nCould give them any Balm--\nOr would they go on aching still\nThrough Centuries of Nerve--\nEnlightened to a larger Pain--\nIn Contrast with the Love--\nThe Grieved--are many--I am told--\nThere is the various Cause--\nDeath--is but one--and comes but once--\nAnd only nails the eyes--\nThere's Grief of Want--and grief of Cold--\nA sort they call \"Despair\"--\nThere's Banishment from native Eyes--\nIn Sight of Native Air--\nAnd though I may not guess the kind--\nCorrectly--yet to me\nA piercing Comfort it affords\nIn passing Calvary--\nTo note the fashions--of the Cross--\nAnd how they're mostly worn--\nStill fascinated to presume\nThat Some--are like My Own--\n",
