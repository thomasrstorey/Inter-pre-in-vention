  "poem": "I think to Live—may be a Bliss\nTo those who dare to try—\nBeyond my limit to conceive—\nMy lip—to testify—\nI think the Heart I former wore\nCould widen—till to me\nThe Other, like the little Bank\nAppear—unto the Sea—\nI think the Days—could every one\nIn Ordination stand—\nAnd Majesty—be easier—\nThan an inferior kind—\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nnumb alarm—lest Difference come—\nGoblin—on the Bloom—\nstart in Apprehension's Ear,\nBankruptcy—no Doom—\nBut Certainties of Sun—\nMidsummer—in the Mind—\nA steadfast South—upon the Soul—\nHer Polar time—behind—\nThe Vision—pondered long—\nSo plausible becomes\nThat I esteem the fiction—real—\nThe Real—fictitious seems—\nHow bountiful the Dream—\nWhat Plenty—it would be—\nHad all my Life but been Mistake\nJust rectified—in Thee\n",
