  "poem": "These—saw Visions—\nLatch them softly—\nThese—held Dimples—\nSmooth them slow—\nThis—addressed departing accents—\nQuick—Sweet Mouth—to miss thee so—\nThis—We stroked—\nUnnumbered Satin—\nThese—we held among our own—\nFingers of the Slim Aurora—\nNot so arrogant—this Noon—\nThese—adjust—that ran to meet us—\nPearl—for Stocking—Pearl for Shoe—\nParadise—the only Palace\nFit for Her reception—now—\n",
