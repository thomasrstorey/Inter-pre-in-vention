  "poem": "The Loneliness One dare not sound-\nAnd would as soon surmise\nAs in its Grave go plumbing\nTo ascertain the size-\nThe Loneliness whose worst alarm\nIs lest itself should see-\nAnd perish from before itself\nFor just a scrutiny-\nThe Horror not to be surveyed-\nBut skirted in the Dark-\nWith Consciousness suspended-\nAnd Being under Lock-\nI fear me this-is Loneliness-\nThe Maker of the soul\nIts Caverns and its Corridors\nIlluminate-or seal-\n",
