  "poem": "I learned—at least—what Home could be—\nHow ignorant I had been\nOf pretty ways of Covenant—\nHow awkward at the Hymn\nRound our new Fireside—but for this—\nThis pattern—of the Way—\nWhose Memory drowns me, like the Dip\nOf a Celestial Sea—\nWhat Mornings in our Garden—guessed—\nWhat Bees—for us—to hum—\nWith only Birds to interrupt\nThe Ripple of our Theme—\nAnd Task for Both—\nWhen Play be done—\nYour Problem—of the Brain—\nAnd mine—some foolisher effect—\nA Ruffle—or a Tune—\nThe Afternoons—Together spent—\nAnd Twilight—in the Lanes—\nSome ministry to poorer lives—\nSeen poorest—thro' our gains—\nAnd then Return—and Night—and Home—\nAnd then away to You to pass—\nA new—diviner—care—\nTill Sunrise take us back to Scene—\nTransmuted—Vivider—\nThis seems a Home—\nAnd Home is not—\nBut what that Place could be—\nAfflicts me—as a Setting Sun—\nWhere Dawn—knows how to be—\n",
