  "poem": "There cam a Wind like a Bugle -\nIt quivered through the Grass\nAnd a Green Chill upon the Heat\nSo ominous did pass\nWe barred the Windows and the Doors\nAs from an Emerald Ghost -\nThe Doom's electric Moccasin\nThe very instant passed -\nOn a strange Mob of panting Trees\nAnd Fences fled away\nAnd Rivers where the Houses ran\nThose looked that lived - that Day -\nThe Bell within the steeple wild\nThe flying tidings told -\nHow much can come\nAnd much can go,\nAnd yet abide the World!\n",
