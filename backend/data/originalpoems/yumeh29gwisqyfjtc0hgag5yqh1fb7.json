  "poem": "A Coffin—is a small Domain,\nYet able to contain\nA Citizen of Paradise\nIn it diminished Plane.\nA Grave—is a restricted Breadth—\nYet ampler than the Sun—\nAnd all the Seas He populates\nAnd Lands He looks upon\nTo Him who on its small Repose\nBestows a single Friend—\nCircumference without Relief—\nOr Estimate—or End—\n",
