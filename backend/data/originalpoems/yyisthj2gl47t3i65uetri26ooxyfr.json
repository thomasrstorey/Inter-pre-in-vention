  "poem": "Bereaved of all, I went abroad-\nNo less bereaved was I\nUpon a New Peninsula-\nThe Grave preceded me-\nObtained my Lodgings, ere myself-\nAnd when I sought my Bed-\nThe Grave it was reposed upon\nThe Pillow for my Head-\nI waked to find it first awake-\nI rose-It followed me-\nI tried to drop it in the Crowd-\nTo lose it in the Sea-\nIn Cups of artificial Drowse\nTo steep its shape away-\nThe Grave-was finished-but the Spade\nRemained in Memory-\n",
